Driver finally turned up in the Season 7 finale to confront Oliver about his comments and encourage Oliver to maybe go outside, get some fresh air, and stop focusing on him as a result — all of which led to the satisfying payoff of <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzlCOg-37hI\" target=\"_blank\">watching Oliver blow up 2020.</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nSo, how exactly did Driver's cameo come to be? Oliver got the chance to explain himself during a recent interview with <strong>Seth Meyers </strong>for <strong><em>Late Night with Seth Meyers</em></strong>. Things got very lighthearted when Meyers steered the conversation toward Driver's role in the Season 7 finale. When asked how it all came together, Oliver began, &quot;The initial seed was one of our writers writing a very weird joke that went absolutely nowhere. Then, the water on that seed — back when we had an audience in March — was feeling real resistance from that audience about the joke. It felt like they about 40% enjoyed it. It locked in my head of, 'Oh, let's try and do this again,' so we did it as a callback a few weeks later and [the audience] weren't really happy to have it back. At that point, it became something of an obsession [with] our staff. A few months into the bit, we kind of broke it. One of the writers had written something saying, 'I don't know if he would enjoy this,' and that was as much of a ribbon as it felt we could put on it. &quot;\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/adam-driver-last-week-tonight-season-7-finale-cameo.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nOliver continued, explaining to Meyers that the <em>Last Week Tonight </em>team decided to take a chance and see if Driver would be interested in leveling up the bit with an actual appearance. According to the <em>Last Week Tonight </em>host: &quot;So, at that point, we reached out to him and said, 'I don't know if you know what we've been doing. There's no easy way into this conversation. We've been making some comments about you and would you, hypothetically, be interested in responding toward the end of the year?' The message came back from him saying, 'He has heard about it, he thinks it's very strange, and he's in.' So we thought, 'Great,' and we didn't know what we were going to do but at least at that point, we had an end in sight. As it turns out, the end was him calling into the show and explaining the ways in which he was going to demolish me.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nDriver's appearance on <em>Last Week Tonight </em>is one for the history books. Not only did it pay off handsomely, but it offered Driver the chance to jokingly tell Oliver that he was an &quot;unbaked gingerbread boy,&quot; which, if nothing else, should keep you chuckling all the way to 2021.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll episodes of <em>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver </em>Season 7 are now available to stream on HBO Max.

The Starz show takes place in Berlin and follows a man named Howard Silk (<strong>J.K. Simmons</strong>, delivering a phenomenal performance), a lowly cog in the bureaucracy of a secretive Berlin-based UN spy agency. But he discovers in the show’s first episode that his workplace harbors a secret: 30 years ago, a rip opened up in Berlin revealing a parallel dimension. At first, both dimensions were exactly the same, but shortly after the rip, small differences turned into significant alterations, and now both sides view one another with extreme caution. The only mode of travel between the two dimensions is underneath Howard’s building, and the existence of this second dimension is the world’s best-kept secret.\n</p>\n<p>\nHoward’s life is turned upside down when his “counterpart” arrives in his dimension, and he’s almost nothing like him—self-assured, aggressive, and hardened. The show is more in the vein of <strong><em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em></strong> than something like Bourne, and while it was cancelled after two seasons, the Season 2 finale puts a perfect button on the show’s biggest mysteries so while there’s certainly desire to see more, <em>Counterpart</em> stands as a compelling, wildly engrossing, and satisfying little two-season miniseries. – Adam Chitwood\n</p>\n<p>\n<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Mans-Land-Part-Two/dp/B077MZ9G44\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch <em>Counterpart </em>on Amazon Here</strong></a>\n</p>\n<h2>\nThe Expanse</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/the-expanse-cast.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>Created By:</strong> Mark Fergus &amp; Hawk Ostby\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cast:</strong> Thomas Jane, Steven Strait, Cas Anvar, Wes Chatham, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Dominique Tipper\n</p>\n<p>\nAt its new home on Amazon Prime Video, the former Syfy series <strong><em>The Expanse</em></strong> continues its impressive run as one of the most challenging, rewarding, and complex sci-fi shows on the air, now with more resources and creative freedom than ever. Adapted from <strong>James S.A. Corey</strong>’s award-winning, ongoing series of sci-fi novels, <em>The Expanse</em> is set 200 years in the future in a colonized solar system where the citizens of Earth, Mars and the asteroid belt wage constant conflict over territories, freedoms, and the future of mankind, while nefarious government secrets and conspiracies threaten the galaxy in the background.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's dense and rich material, attuned to the real-world realities of politicking and pandering while building an immersive and intricately nuanced science fiction world. And the latest batch of episodes doesn't just bring <em>The Expanse</em> to its new streaming home, it brings the characters to a new world, where the series gets to craft its colonialist examination with more real-time fallout than ever. And it all remains utterly fascinating; a complex autopsy of political systems and the manipulation of warring beliefs that never skimps on meaty character drama or good, old-fashioned space spectacle. -- <em>Haleigh Foutch</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dulcinea/dp/B08B49PKRL/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch <em>The Expanse </em>on Amazon Here</strong></a>\n</p>\n<h2>\nDead Like Me</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dead-like-me-show.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<em>Watch with ads via IMDb TV</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Creator:</b> Bryan Fuller\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cast:</b> Ellen Muth, Mandy Patinkin, Laura Harris, Callum Blue, Jasmine Guy, Cynthia Stevenson,\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Bryan Fuller</b>'s production company is called Living Dead Guy, and the inspiration for that might be, in part, the first show he ever created.

Best of all, it's relentlessly heartfelt and shamelessly silly, even when Gaiman and Pratchett's witty words don't land with the same snap they had on the page. -- <em>Haleigh Foutch</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Official-Trailer/dp/B089XXLCST/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch <em>Good Omens</em><em> </em>on Amazon Here</strong></a>\n</p>\n<h2>\nTom Clancy's Jack Ryan</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jack-ryan-season-2-john-krasinski-noomi-rapace.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>Created by:</strong> Carlton Cuse and Graham Roland\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cast:</strong> John Krasinski, Abbie Cornish, and Wendell Pierce\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile<a href=\"http://www.collider.com/tag/jack-ryan/\"><strong><em> Jack Ryan</em> </strong></a>may not be on the level of prestige TV like<strong><em> Breaking Bad</em> </strong>or <strong><em>Mad Men</em></strong> or even <strong><em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em></strong>, it’s a very solid throwback series for fans of mid-budget thrillers.

The ever-affable <strong>John Krasinski</strong> proves to be a formidable fit for the title character, and <strong>Wendell Pierce</strong> brings some welcome complexity to the role of James Greer, Ryan’s boss at the CIA. The Season 1 storyline is a mix between<strong><em> Homeland</em> </strong>and <strong><em>24</em> </strong>as Ryan tracks an Islamic terrorist, and while your mileage may vary, it’s a pretty compelling season-long arc with tremendous production value.

Thank goodness the delightful, lightly comedic procedural crime series is available on Amazon Prime Video and thank goodness -- and trust that this’ll be the only time I ever say this -- for the autoplay feature. I typically loathe this feature, as it doesn’t give a viewer any chance to digest what they just watched. But for something like Bones, a delightful summer mocktail in a TV world of bitter old fashioneds, it gives you those perfect throwback feelings of letting fleet, entertaining, and unchallenging (in the best way!) programming just wash over you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Emily Deschanel</strong> stars as Dr. Brennan Temperance, an overly intellectual forensic anthropologist who’s ironically gifted the titular nickname of “Bones” by FBI agent Seeley Booth (<strong>David Boreanaz</strong>). The two solve criminal cases together, taking advantage of their crackerjack, familiar “bickering co-workers/love interests” chemistry we’ve seen in shows like Moonlighting and even The X-Files. But as you keep swimming through the series, the rest of the ensemble cast gets their opportunity to shine, clown, and affect your dang heart. With so many contemporary crime TV shows practically daring you to keep watching with their cynical misanthropy, it’s nice to take a dip in one warmer waters for a change. -- <em>Gregory Lawrence</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pilot/dp/B000HVMML2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch <em>Bones</em><em> </em>on Amazon Here</strong></a>\n</p>\n<h2>\nFarscape</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/farscape-zhaan.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<b>Creator:</b> Rockne S.

What ensues is one of television's most weird, wacky, horny, heartfelt adventures, as this &quot;crew&quot; (a gang of oddballs including a former stormtrooper, a sexy plant lady, and a former emperor who farts helium, the latter of whom is played by a Henson-quality puppet) struggle for survival, and Crichton looks for a way home. <i>Farscape</i> goes a bit off the rails by the end, but the journey remains a delight. - <i>Liz Shannon Miller</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Liars-Guns-Money-Friends-These/dp/B07PMVFHL6\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch <em>Farscape</em><em> </em>on Amazon Here</strong></a>\n</p>\n<h2>\nThe Mentalist</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-mentalist.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>Creator: </strong>Bruno Heller\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cast: </strong>Simon Baker, Robin Tunney, Tim Kang, Owain Yeoman, Amanda Righetti\n</p>\n<p>\n<div>\n\n<p>\n<div>\n\n<p>\nProcedurals are the comfort food of primetime TV.

During the interview, O'Connor talked about how <em>The Crown</em> creator <strong>Peter Morgan</strong> manages to make such an incredible series, what it’s like behind-the-scenes, what fans might be surprised to learn, how his opinion of Charles as a royal and a public figure has changed, what it was like filming the fight scenes with <strong>Emma Corrin</strong> as <strong>Princess Diana</strong>, and so much more.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Crown</em> Season 4 sees the 1970s drawing to a close, with Queen Elizabeth (<strong>Olivia Colman</strong>) and her family finding themselves preoccupied with safeguarding the line of succession by securing an appropriate bride for Prince Charles (O’Connor), who is still unmarried at 30. As the nation begins to feel the impact of divisive policies introduced by Britain's first female Prime Minister <strong>Margaret Thatcher</strong> (<strong>Gillian Anderson</strong>), tensions arise between her and the Queen which only grow worse as Thatcher leads the country into the Falklands War, generating conflict within the Commonwealth. While Charles’ romance with a young <strong>Lady Diana Spencer</strong> (Corrin) provides a much-needed fairytale to unite the British people, behind closed doors, the Royal family is becoming increasingly divided.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The</em> <em>Crown</em><em>‘s</em> fourth season also stars <strong>Helena Bonham Carter</strong> as <strong>Princess Margaret</strong>, <strong>Tobias Menzies</strong> as The Duke of Edinburgh, <strong>Erin Doherty</strong> as <strong>Princess Anne</strong>, <strong>Emerald Fennell</strong> as <strong>Camilla Parker Bowles</strong>, <strong>Marion Bailey</strong> as the Queen Mother, <strong>Georgie Glen</strong> as <strong>Lady Fermoy</strong>, <strong>Tom Byrne</strong> as <strong>Prince Andrew</strong>, <strong>Angue Imrie</strong> as <strong>Prince</strong> <strong>Edward</strong>, and <strong>Charles Dance</strong> as <strong>Lord Mountbatten.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nCheck out what Josh O'Connor had to say below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>COLLIDER: I'm going to start with, I think, the most important question; were you more nervous stepping on the set as a young actor on <em><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/doctor-who/\">Doctor Who</a></em> or meeting Peter Morgan for the first time?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nJOSH O’CONNOR: Actually, I know you'd probably think it would be <em>The Crown</em>, but no, it was <em>Doctor Who</em> was because Doctor Who was one of my first ever jobs. I think I'd done one job before that, which was just one line, and this was a bit more than that, not very much more. I remember being petrified. A little fun fact for you: in the same episode that I was in and <em>Doctor Who</em> was Tobias Menzies, Prince Philip no less, although we never met on that job. We found the out recently. It was quite a fun little story.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>That's actually very funny. I had no idea.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: Yeah, isn't that great?\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-crown-season-4-Emma-Corrin-Josh-OConnor-3-scaled.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>I would imagine actually as a young actor and also <em>Doctor Who</em> in the UK is massive. It's massive around the world, but especially in the UK.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: Yes. Very much so, yeah. That was maybe eight years ago now, I've been working for a good nine years now, and I still, to this day, receive more fan mail about <em>Doctor Who</em> than I do for any other job. I was literally in it for one minute, so there you go.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I am a massive fan of what Peter Morgan has done in his career and especially on <em>The Crown</em>. Can you talk a little bit about meeting with him for the first time?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: Yeah, sure. Well yeah, like you, I was a great admirer of his pre <em>The Crown</em>, and then <em>The Crown</em> was obviously such an incredible series. I think when I first met him, I went over to his house actually for one of his script sessions. I'd read some of the scenes from episode six of season three and it was terrific. He was open. He's got such a handle on the story. He's an incredible person actually and such a talent and continues to write these amazing stories. It's a real honor to have been involved in <em>The Crown</em>, in big part, because of him.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I think a lot of people don't realize how difficult it is to make a television series and to make a television series that is exceptional year in and year out. Season four is just as awesome as season one. How the F does he do this?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: I don't know. He's an amazing talent really. I don't know how he does it. Look, he has such to grasp on story and character and he understands family. I think when it comes down to it, the greatest story of <em>The Crown</em> is to do with family and to do with the balance of power and empathy. He's got some sort of superhuman access to those words. Every time a script came and lands on my desk, I was always in awe of what he created. Yeah, he's a real special man.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What do you think might surprise fans of the series to learn about the behind the scenes making of <em>The Crown</em>?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: Well, I'm still always surprised by the level of research. I don't know if anyone else would be surprised by it. When I first signed up to the show, I was sent an email with about five people CC'd in, and I was just told, &quot;If you have any questions about anything to do with Charles, this is your team.&quot; It was my Prince Charles team. Literally any question I had, I would email them. It might be a very simple question like, &quot;What kind of side salad does he have,&quot; and then you'd get back information on the salads that Prince Charles ordered and that sort of thing. That kind of level of detail is extraordinary. Yeah, I suppose, if there was one piece, I think that would be it for me.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-crown-season-4-Emma-Corrin-Josh-OConnor-4-scaled.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>What was your understanding of Charles as a royal and a public figure before signing on to do <em>The Crown</em>?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: Well, not very interesting because I suppose I was just disinterested. I wasn't engaged in it in any way. I hadn't thought too much about Charles apart from in the periphery, he was ever present as the entire royal family are, but I never really thought too deeply about him. Now, of course, I think about him regularly and I think he's an incredible man and has done lots of brilliant things, but certainly at the time, yeah, I was maybe just not aware so much.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How has playing him for two seasons changed your view of him and maybe of the royal family?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: I think it's changed it greatly. It is a funny one because ultimately we are working with invention. They're inventing these characters and they are fictionalized versions of history. In some ways, I don't feel any differently except that I think inevitably when you play someone, your job as an actor, we work in empathy and we have to feel that empathy for those characters.\n</p>\n<p>\nI suppose, yeah, I've got a lot more time for him. I understand his difficulties. I think he's done an incredible job talking about the environment for so long. We used to laugh at him with regards to the environment. Now, we realized that he was right all along. I think they're an incredible bunch of individuals, but I still remain skeptical about the royal family as a structure and that hasn't changed as such. Yeah, I've a huge respect for him as a person.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I have to ask you about filming the fight scenes with Emma Corrin as Princess Diana, because you're putting on screen stuff that we've really never seen, like the angry side of Charles. What was it like filming those fight scenes with her?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: Not very nice, only because Emma is such a great friend, and so I always felt awful afterwards. No, you're right. We haven't seen them, but I imagine that they would have had shouting matches that they might not have done. I think that particularly the one in episode 10 where I'm screaming, &quot;I refuse any longer to be blamed for this grotesque misalliance,&quot; that, to me was pure Peter Morgan joy. What a line that is. Yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed them and I enjoyed them because I got to play across from Emma, who's a terrific actor and use Peter Morgan's lines, which are of course, often beautifully articulate and real and believable. Yeah, I loved that.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-crown-emma-corrin-josh-o-connor-slice-scaled.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>How is it in terms of the blocking and staging of those scenes? How long does it take to film a scene like that?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: Well, it depends. I cited that scene as a really important scene and it didn't take too many takes, that one, to be honest, partly because there was only so much my voice could take doing that scene too many times. It can really depend on so many things. Some days you just get it right, and some days you need to dig a bit deeper and find different ways of doing it and experiment a bit and find things you maybe weren't expecting. Yeah, definitely it varies, I think.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Through the season on Season 4, looking back, which do you think was the stuff that you were most excited to do? Was there anything that really made you nervous to film?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: I think that one of the scenes I was most excited about filming actually was a scene with Tobias in episode one where Charles comes in and finds Prince Philip drunk and they have this horrible scene really, but that was a pleasure to film and I was so looking forward to it because Tobias is a great friend and I'm a great admirer of him as an actor. I just loved working with him.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn terms of nerve wracking, I will never forget, I know it's not Season 4, but I was in season three, standing up in front of everyone and speaking Welsh was a terrifying prospect. I will never forget the fear that I had just before that. No, other than that, it's been a total joy and I've really enjoyed every minute.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Actually, you did great in that scene when you were speaking. I completely spaced on that, but man, you're right. That must have been really, really nerve wracking.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: It really was, yeah.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>One of the things about a lot of American TV is that scripts, and even movies, scripts can change often where actors are getting pink and purple and green pages constantly and tweaking dialogue and what might be filmed. How is it on <em>The Crown</em> in terms of when you get a script and what you're actually putting on screen?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: Well, Peter writes way in advance so you get the scripts quite early on. They do change and that's inevitable as you say. It's very hard to not change as you go through. They do change, but in my experience, not as much as most things. By the time you get the script, Peter has pretty much explored every option and he knows those scripts back to front. Sometimes there might be the odd day where people turn up to set and he'll hear it and there's something about the actors performing it and he'll to think, &quot;Do you know what? Let's change this or let's change that,&quot; because something about the music of it isn't quite right in his head.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe's a lyrical writer, but he's also a musical writer. I think there's something in the rhythm of some of those scenes, much in the same way that Shakespeare writes in those kind of rhythmic ways. Sometimes he will shift something, and it just flips the scene its head. Yeah, in terms of the changes I would say not as much as most shows, actually.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-crown-emma-corrin-josh-o-connor-2-1-scaled.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>I have to ask you, have you heard of Charles or if any of the royal family actually watches the series?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: I have heard mixed things. Some people have said to me, &quot;Of course they watch it,&quot; and some people say, &quot;I've heard they have watched it,&quot; and then some people have said, &quot;Absolutely not. I don't think they'd ever watch it.&quot; My opinion is I can't imagine they'd want to watch it, but who knows? I know if there was ever a series made about me, the last thing I'd ever do is watch it. If Charles anything like me, I can't imagine he has, but who knows?\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For whoever takes over the role of Charles, is there any advice that you would share?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: I think in some ways there is no advice. It's just as in the theater, if you play a Richard the Second or Hamlet or whoever it is, there are hundreds of actors before you who played him and there are hundreds of actors after who will play him. That's what I love about <em>The Crown </em>is that I very much think that it's about whoever takes over, taking control of that and doing it their way. Yeah, I look forward to whoever takes it on and I wish them the best of luck.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Speaking of the theater, you've done the theater many times. Do you still get super nervous before you're going to step on stage or have you reached the point now where it's become comfortable?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: Ooh, good question. I haven't stepped on stage for a little while now. I was supposed to be doing a play right now, but unfortunately, because of COVID, it's not happening, although we're starting tomorrow. It's <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> at the National Theater but we're doing it as a film version now. I don't think so. The stage is just in some ways in the same way as television or film, if you know the words and if you understand the character, if you've done the work, it's just a different venue, essentially. I love it. I love the theater, that was my first love, so I'll never stop loving the theater, I don't think. I can't wait to be able to come back and see theater and stand on stages again. I really miss that.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-crown-season-4-Josh-OConnor-scaled.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>Well, it's funny is you brought up <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and believe me, I was getting there. I'm a big fan of Jessie Buckley and you're doing it with her. I find it fascinating because you were going to do this as a stage production, and now you're going to use the Littleton theater as a film studio. How exactly is this going to work?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: I'm not sure is the short answer. We don't know. I'm glad you're a fan of Jessie's because I am too. She's one of my great friends and we've been friends for many years and have been trying to do something together for a very long time. <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>came up about just over a year ago. They approached us about it together and we jumped at the chance and thought, &quot;This is probably our last chance to play Romeo and Juliet, otherwise we're getting a bit old.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nYeah, I think we, we were devastated that we're not going to be able to as a live production, although whether we do it later down the line…but for now, we start tomorrow. If I knew anything more, I would tell you, but the joy of this is I think we're going in and we're going to make it whatever it is. We're going to discover it together. It might well turn out to be something like the kind of <em>Uncle Vanya on 42nd Street</em>, or it could be more of an NT live version or it could be a more of a filming version. We're not entirely sure and that's the joy is that we're going in and we're going to work out together, I think.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I would suggest watching if you can, the live version of what they just did recently with Aaron Sorkin's <em>West Wing</em>, which they filmed.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: I have. I've seen it and I loved it. It was terrific. I'm a huge <em>West Wing</em> fan, so I love that so much.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>That's because Aaron Sorkin and Peter Morgan are cut from the same cloth.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: You're absolutely right. I think you're right.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Listen, I'm just going to say congrats on <em>The Crown</em>, Season 4, and your work on the series. It's exceptionally well-made and your work has been great. Great talking with you.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nO’CONNOR: Thanks so much.

There's no title yet, and Garland is still lining up financing, but he's hoping to start production this coming spring or summer, depending on cast availability.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I wrote a low-budget horror movie, set in the UK,&quot; Garland told Empire in the most recent issue. &quot;I don't know if it's unrealistic or not. Always at this particular moment, a film always feels unrealistic, but then somehow it works out.”\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/annihilation-movie-cast.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nGarland is the acclaimed screenwriter behind <strong>Danny Boyle</strong>'s <em><strong>28 Days Later</strong></em> and <em><strong>Sunshine</strong></em>, as well as <em><strong>Dredd</strong></em> and <em><strong>Never Let Me Go</strong></em>. He made his directorial debut with the 2014 thriller <em><strong>Ex Machina</strong></em> starring <strong>Domnhall Gleeson</strong>, <strong>Alicia Vikander</strong> and <strong>Oscar Isaac</strong> before moving on to the sci-fi horror movie <em><strong>Annihilation</strong></em> starring <strong>Natalie Portman</strong> and Isaac.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Oscar-nominated writer had been planning a new TV series about the ineffectual and surface-level state of protests in recent years, but that idea went out the window following the events of this summer, when millions of people around the world took to the streets in support of Black Lives Matter following the death of <strong>George Floyd</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n“At some point with civil disobedience, you have to start smashing stuff up. So I was writing about the need to smash stuff up,” explained Garland. But once he saw the palpable anger that was alive in the streets of both major cities and small towns, he felt there was no need for the series, which could have featured several actors from <em>Devs</em>.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ex-machina-oscar-isaac.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n“I thought, ‘So now what I’m writing is pointless.’ In a good way. I almost felt glad, weirdly.” That's when Garland decided to pivot to the new horror movie.\n</p>\n<p>\nI'm actually relieved to see Garland return to the world of features, as <em>Devs</em> was tough to get into. He served as creator, writer, director and showrunner on the cerebral series, and while some swore by it, others found the material hard to penetrate. I watched an episode or two and found it just wasn't for me. It seems my patience is wearing thin in my old age, and gone are are the days when I'd take a friend's word that I just had to give <em><strong>The Wire</strong></em> five episodes before things picked up. The TV landscape is simply too competitive these days. You have to hook audiences right from the start, because that second episode is no longer a given.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut that's just one man's perspective.

After months of speculation and gossip, and without so much as an official <em>sneeze</em> from anybody at Lucasfilm or Disney+, <strong>Rosario Dawson</strong> debuted as Ahsoka Tano on <strong><em><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/the-mandalorian\">The Mandalorian</a></em></strong>. And for some die-hard <em>Star Wars</em> fans this was a <em>huge moment</em>, serving as the fulfillment of some long-held dreams and the entrance of a beloved character into the more accessible main thoroughfare of the franchise. But if you are one of the viewers who were wondering, <em>wait, who is this character</em>? Or, perhaps more importantly, <em>why is her showing up such a big deal</em>? Well, we’ve got you covered.\n</p>\n<h2>\nWho Is She?</h2>\n<p>\nThe character (voiced by <strong>Ashley Eckstein</strong>) first appeared in 2008’s <strong><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em></strong>, a prequel film that would serve as the kick-off to <strong>George Lucas</strong> and <strong>Dave Filoni</strong>’s <em>The Clone Wars</em> animated series, introduced as Anakin Skywalker’s padawan. In the film and in early seasons of the series, which would air until 2013 before being brought back for a final crop of episodes earlier this year, Ahsoka was initially portrayed as Anakin’s bratty, annoying sidekick. (She infamously referred to Anakin Skywalker, who would go on to become the dark scourge of the galaxy, as “Skyguy.”) But as the series went on, she became a powerful Jedi, one who helped liberate Mandalore (which will undoubtedly tie into future episodes) and fought valiantly against the Separatist armies across the cosmos. And, of course, as things progressed, her closeness with Anakin became even more tragic, as we knew that he would turn to the dark side and she would eventually have to face off against her former mentor and friend.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe also became a key ally for Rex, a Clone Trooper who has been reinserted into the main continuity as the guy with the white beard on Endor in <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/clone-wars-season-7-episode-10-images-rex-bo-katan-ahsoka-scaled.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nWhat makes her really interesting is her complicated relationship with the Jedi. She was taken away from her family by the Jedi Master Plo Koon (from the prequels) who understood that she was highly in tune with The Force. But after being prosecuted for an attack against the Jedi that she didn’t commit, she found herself a wayward Force user, neither Jedi nor Sith. To that end, she designed her new lightsabers with a white blade, signifying her nebulousness. This also allowed her to slip out of the official canon, allowing the references to the last remaining Jedi in the original trilogy being Luke and Leia to remain technically true (should she survive that long). It also makes the title of the episode, “The Jedi,” somewhat curious.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter Order 66 (the order to kill all of the Jedi, as dramatized in the film <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> and in the final four episodes of <em>Clone Wars</em>) was enacted, Ahsoka fled, eventually becoming an agent for Bail Organa (Leia’s father) under the codename Fulcrum. That’s when she met up with the crew of Rebels onboard the Ghost in <strong><em>Star Wars Rebels</em></strong> (which ran for 75 episodes from 2014 to 2018), a sort of animated follow-up to <em>Clone Wars</em> that employed the same animation style but was set in the early days of the Rebellion.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe has fought Darth Vader and Darth Maul, been pulled into a kind of Force-y netherworld, and become a true hero to fans of <em>Star Wars</em>, arguably becoming the most popular character to never actually appear in one of the canonical live-action <em>Star Wars</em> “saga” films. Countless fans have dressed up as her for Star Wars Celebration and other fan conventions and paid tribute to her in many different forms online, including some truly stunning fan art. And now she’s on <em>The Mandalorian</em>. Huzzah!\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/clone-wars-season-7-episode-10-images-ahsoka-scaled.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<h2>\nWhat is Her Connection to The Mandalorian (and Bo-Katan)?</h2>\n<p>\nAhsoka Tano entered The Mandalorian first via dialogue spoken by Bo-Katan (<strong>Katee Sackhoff</strong>), the titular character in Episode 3, “The Heiress.” She is the sister of Duchess Satine, who wanted to subdue the warmongering ways of the Mandalorians and bring peace to the planet. Bo-Katan rebelled, first forming an insurgent group called the Death Watch, eventually forming a different group, the Night Owls, once Darth Maul took control of the planet. This is where Ahsoka Tano comes in, as she helped to liberate the planet, allowing for the Darksaber to eventually be transferred to Bo-Katan. Clearly, something happened since the weapon is now in the hands of Moff Gideon (<strong>Giancarlo Esposito</strong>) and Bo really, really wants it back, in part to return the planet to its former glory. (Hopefully, we haven’t seen the last of Bo-Katan on <em>The Mandalorian</em>.)\n</p>\n<p>\nBo-Katan and Ahsoka have clearly been keeping in touch, since Bo-Katan knows where Ahsoka is (when we last saw her, further on in the timeline at the end of <em>Rebels</em>, she was searching for Ezra Bridger, whom she had left in the aforementioned wonky Jedi netherworld). Could they team up once again to get the Darksaber back from Gideon? And will she help guide The Child (aka Baby Yoda) train to be a Jedi? Take him back to his kind? Or something else altogether?\n</p>\n<p>\nIt’s also worth mentioning that on <em>Rebels</em> Ahsoka formed a close bond with Sabine Wren, a Mandalorian onboard the Ghost, leading to speculation that Sabine could be entering the live-action realm of <em>The Mandalorian</em> very soon.  The final  sequence of <em>Rebels</em> was an epilogue that took place after <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, putting it in roughly the same time period as <em>The Mandalorian</em>.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/star-wars-clone-wars-bo-katan-ahsoka-tano-2.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<h2>\nHas She Been Teased in Live-Action Before?</h2>\n<p>\nHere’s the interesting thing: Ahsoka Tano has actually made appearances in the so-called “saga” films. You can hear her voice (once again supplied by Ashley Eckstein) in <strong><em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></strong> in the moment when Rey is being encouraged from beyond the grave by the Jedi that came before her (again muddying the waters of whether or not she’s actually a Jedi). This has led to speculation that she has died in between the events of <em>Rebels</em> and <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, something that might not necessarily be true, especially given the confusion around whether or not she’s an actual Jedi anymore and if her time in the aforementioned netherworld has given her some additional abilities.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt’s also worth noting that she could have technically been in a live-action Star Wars movie already, we just haven’t seen her – the Ghost, the ship from <em>Rebels</em>, takes part in the Battle of Scarif at the end of <strong><em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em></strong>. We never see <em>inside</em> of the ship, but we know that Hera Syndulla, the pilot of the Ghost (who is referred to in the movie as “General” meaning she has risen in the ranks), is still in command of her old ship and others, like Ahsoka Tano, could be there alongside her.\n</p>\n<p>\nNew episodes of <em>The Mandalorian</em> premiere Fridays on Disney+.

When nine men and women, including Frank and leader of the British Black Panther Movement <strong>Altheia Jones-LeCointe</strong> (<strong>Letitia Wright</strong>), and activist Darcus Howe (<strong>Malachi Kirby</strong>), are wrongly arrested and charged with incitement to riot, a highly publicized trial ensues, leading to hard-fought win for those fighting against discrimination. <em>Mangrove</em> also stars <strong>Rochenda Sandall</strong>, <strong>Jack Lowden</strong>, <strong>Sam Spruell</strong>, <strong>Gershwyn</strong> <strong>Eustache</strong>, <strong>Nathaniel Martello-White</strong>, <strong>Richie Campbell</strong>, <strong>Jumayn Hunter</strong>, and<strong> Gary Beadle</strong>. <em>Mangrove</em> was co-written by <strong>Alastair Siddons</strong> and McQueen.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/small-axe-mangrove-steve-mcqueen.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nShortly after seeing the powerful film, I was able to talk with Letitia Wright.

The plot follows Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa (<strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong>) as he basks in his glorious wealth alongside his friend and former rival Apollo Creed (<strong>Carl Weathers</strong>), who is enjoying his retirement as a boxing legend. However, when a Russian ubermensch named Ivan Drago (<strong>Dolph Lundgren</strong>) arrives in America to challenge Rocky, Apollo takes it as a personal insult and challenges Drago himself to an exhibition match in Las Vegas. Ignoring the advice of both Rocky and pretty much everyone else around him, Apollo comes out of retirement to fight Drago, only to get beaten literally to death in the opening seconds of the 2<sup>nd</sup> round.\n</p>\n<p>\nObviously, Rocky is inconsolable over this tragedy, and he swears an oath of vengeance to a <strong>Robert Tepper</strong> song while driving in his sports car. He accepts a Christmas Day bout against Drago, and travels to the wilds of Siberia to train for the fight. After several agonizing rounds going toe to toe with his friend’s murderer, Rocky delivers a flurry of blows that topples the Russian to win the bout. He then grabs the microphone and gives a rousing speech about change that 90% of the audience cannot possibly understand. By the time he is finished speaking, the entire Soviet Union is applauding both him and the American Spirit, effectively destroying the communist regime years before it actually dissolved. The credits roll at 87 minutes, ten of which were devoted entirely to montages. It is a perfect film.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, after having nearly four decades to absorb the many intricacies of <em>Rocky IV</em>, it’s high time we discussed one of its unspoken truths, something every <em>Rocky</em> fan has had to quietly reconcile but has never dared to speak aloud. Fellow Balboners, it’s time we addressed the fact that Apollo Creed 100% deserved to get his ass kicked.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rocky-iv-carl-weathers-dolph-lundgren.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nNow before you go flooding my inbox with “how dare you” and “bad take” and “Apollo Creed actually crawls out of the Sarlacc pit in the Extended Universe,” let me clarify that I am not saying Apollo Creed deserved to get his ass kicked <em>to death</em>. All I’m saying is that Apollo spends his brief screen time in <em>Rocky IV</em> being a gigantic asshole so desperate to cling to his former glory that he makes it his personal mission to publicly embarrass Drago, a man who has done absolutely nothing to offend Apollo beyond merely existing. Had Drago simply beaten the shit out of him instead of killing him, the audience would’ve collectively murmured, “Yeah, he kinda had that coming.” Being a balls-out mid-80s jingoistic drama, the movie never arrives at this conclusion, despite making several powerful arguments in its favor.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst, some context. <em>Rocky the Fourth</em> is the third sequel to <em><strong>Rocky</strong></em>, the movie that earned Sylvester Stallone two Oscar nominations and made him an international movie star. That film is a cinema verité style drama about a small-time fighter who gets a shot at the heavyweight title because the champ (Apollo Creed, forever an asshole) wants to fight some local chud and embarrass him. Much like he does during his eventual fight against Drago, Apollo even wears an Uncle Sam costume to the ring, because that is his fetish. Rocky takes the fight seriously, however, and shocks the world by going the distance with Apollo, ultimately losing the bout via split decision. It’s a powerful film that is firmly grounded in reality.\n</p>\n<p>\nFast-forward nine years to <em>Rocky IV</em>, which begins with an American boxing glove and a Russian boxing glove punching each other and exploding. Rocky is now so far removed from his situation in the first film that he casually presents his brother-in-law with a sentient robot as a reward for not succumbing to massive heart failure as they celebrate his birthday in Rocky’s palatial mansion. The disconnect between <em>Rocky</em> and <em>Rocky IV</em> is absolutely hilarious. It should come as little surprise to learn that Rocky IV was released the same year as <em><strong>Rambo: First Blood Part Two</strong></em>, another Stallone sequel that completely abandons the serious, grounded drama of the original film in favor of recasting the main character as a cartoonishly larger-than-life American hero. The 1980s were magnificent, you guys. It is in this environment that <em>Rocky IV</em> is able to make Apollo Creed behave like an embarrassing dickhead without consciously realizing it. Let’s examine.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rocky-iv-carl-weathers-sylvester-stallone.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nApollo is comfortably living in retirement in a giant mansion with a loving wife, a gigantic swimming pool, and two extremely good dogs. While joyously splashing around in said pool with aforementioned Good Boys, he looks over at his outdoor television and catches a press conference about Ivan Drago. It is interesting to note that while having a TV propped up on a piece of patio furniture in your backyard would get you a citation from your homeowner’s association in 2020, it was a status symbol of extreme wealth in 1985.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring that press conference, Drago’s wife Ludmilla (<strong>Brigitte Nielson</strong>) is extremely cordial and professional when discussing her hopes for her husband’s boxing success. But Apollo inexplicably takes that shit personally, and vows to punish Drago for having the absolute temerity to come to the United States and challenge Rocky Balboa to a fight. That’s really it. The film was made during the height of the Cold War in the 1980s, and back then, villains didn’t really need to do anything outside of “being Russian” to be considered villains. Sure, there are some scenes later on in which Drago’s pompous trainer starts ranting about Soviet superiority, but Ludmilla remains extremely diplomatic, and Drago himself never says anything. He just stands there, looking like a wax figure of Dolph Lundgren. And this is enough to make Apollo Creed <em>furious</em>. The cool waters of his million-dollar swimming pool are no comfort to the blinding rage of seeing a younger athlete on television. “How dare he be Russian?!” Apollo screams inside his heart, outwardly scowling with all of the power afforded him by his considerable mustache.\n</p>\n<p>\nObviously, Apollo cannot stand for this, so he immediately leaves retirement to challenge Drago to an exhibition match to prove that Russian boxers cannot fight, no matter how young and in-shape and objectively powerful they are. To his credit, Rocky really tries to talk him out of it, pointing out all of the things I’ve just mentioned in addition to the fact that it’s just an exhibition match, meaning it won’t affect either Apollo’s or Drago’s professional record. It’s just a match for the sake of Apollo’s pride and legacy, neither of which, if you’ve been keeping track, have been in question for one moment of the film. Drago came to America to fight Rocky, and instead got called out by Apollo for the insult of existing.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rocky-iv-dolph-lundgren-carl-weathers.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nDuring a press conference for their fight, Ludmilla refers to Drago as an “international sportsman and ambassador of goodwill,” and when asked if he’s ready to fight a professional boxer, she says, “…we hope he’s qualified to do so… Well, I know he is, but I don’t want to sound too confident.” Perfectly diplomatic and civil. Meanwhile, Apollo quips “I had to teach this young fellow to box, American style,” before spending the rest of the press conference clowning on Drago and interrupting him before he gets a chance to speak. Ludmilla cuts in to say they’re very happy to have the opportunity to fight Apollo, and that Apollo is well known and respected in Russia. But Apollo’s near-psychotic temper flares up again when Ludmilla suggests that Drago “could” win the match, and that it would be a good victory for his career if he did. Apollo responds by shouting that there’s no possible way Drago could ever defeat him, despite the objective fact that Drago is a gigantic marble statue with the demeanor of an executioner who has heard so many cries for mercy the words no longer hold any meaning for him. Once again, Ludmilla responds with civility and merely asks Apollo what makes him so certain he is going to win\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally Drago’s trainer loses his temper and points out the obvious fact – Apollo is too old to be fighting, and certainly too old to be fighting someone like Drago. (He’s 37, and that’s pretty long in the tooth for a boxer.) Apollo gets defensive and calls Drago a “heavy bag with eyeballs,” then insists “I came here to talk about a friendly exhibition bout ‘till Comrade Bigmouth started up.” If you’ll remember, Apollo is the one who has been needling Drago and his team the entire time. Drago’s trainer just finally pushed back, and now Apollo is making a big show of being insulted. It’s real “I’m going to kick sand on you until you kick sand back and then I’m going to run and tell the teacher” energy, and it’s a bad look, Apollo.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe night of the fight, Rocky very correctly points out that they don’t know anything about Drago or how he fights. They’ve never seen any videos of his matches or his training. Rocky gently tries to remind Apollo that he hasn’t fought in five years and that maybe they should postpone until they’re able to get a better idea of what Drago can do in the ring and how to train for it. “This is us against them!” Apollo barks, referring to a Las Vegas exhibition fight against a man to whom he has spoken maybe five sentences. Also, during the entire film, we never once see Apollo discuss the fight with his wife. But you know who does speak to Mrs. Creed? Ludmilla. She approaches Apollo’s wife in the crowd and very respectfully says hello and that she hopes that they can be friends after the fight is over. (This friendship probably did not end up happening.) Ludmilla also points out that Apollo and Drago are sportsmen, and not soldiers in a war.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rocky-iv-james-brown-carl-weathers.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nThe night of the fight, Drago gets an appreciably cool entrance in which he begins below the ring and is slowly lifted up into the building like the King of the Morlocks. Apollo then ambushes him with <strong>James</strong> fucking <strong>Brown</strong> performing &quot;Living in America&quot; live with an entire backup band and an army of dancers waving American flags. Apollo descends from the ceiling on a giant bull head, the avatar of capitalism, wearing an Uncle Sam coat and hat and dancing like a cheeseball. Apollo then skips across the stage and does a hype jog around James Brown, who is so unspeakably high on cocaine he probably doesn’t realize he’s in a movie and believes Carl Weathers is the spirit of America descended from the heavens to commune with him.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe fight begins, and Drago proceeds to beat the absolute christ out of Apollo, to the point where Rocky desperately pleads with his friend to let him throw in the towel and end the match. Apollo refuses, and makes Rocky promise not to call it no matter what happens. Because Rocky is a man in the 1980s, he agrees. (Again, Apollo never once addresses his wife or indeed seems to care much about her opinion at all.) He then stumbles back out into the ring, blinded by blood and pride, to get immediately punched so hard by Drago that his spirit leaves his body.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rocky-iv-carl-weathers-dolph-lundgren-fight.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nObviously his death is sad, because everyone loves Apollo Creed and Carl Weathers, but let’s be real here. Apollo came out of a comfortable retirement, secured by a championship legacy, to fight some guy he’s never met without ever once consulting his wife about it. He then publicly tries to humiliate this man over and over again, even going so far as to bring the Godfather of Soul into it, until ultimately getting his ass kicked so hard he literally dies. Again, I must stress that <em>none </em>of this was necessary. Drago came to fight <em>Rocky</em>, not Apollo. Apollo is never even mentioned in the initial TV press conference. He could’ve just stayed at home, enjoying retirement in his gigantic pool with his wife and his two Very Good Dogs.

The star of unequivocal masterpiece <strong><em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em></strong> can currently be heard reprising her role of Rose Tico in <strong><em><a href=\"http://collider.com/tag/lego-star-wars-holiday-special/\">LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special</a></em></strong> on Disney+ and later this week can be heard in <strong><em>The Croods: A New Age</em></strong>, the surprisingly wonderful sequel to DreamWorks Animation’s 2013 original. In the film she plays Dawn Betterman, a more advanced human who finds the joy in connecting with her inner caveman. (She’s a total hoot.) And if that wasn’t enough, she’ll join Disney royalty in next spring’s animated <strong><em><a href=\"http://collider.com/tag/raya-and-the-last-dragon/\">Raya and the Last Dragon</a></em></strong>. Not too shabby.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe were overjoyed to get to talk to Tran about what her recent immersion in animation has been like, her favorite <em>Star Wars</em> fan interaction (spoiler: it’s not the kind of story you’ll expect), and how badly she wants to go to a seafood buffet with your Croods costar <strong>Nicolas Cage</strong> (when it is safe to do so, of course).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Collider: You've done a lot of animated stuff recently.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nKELLY MARIE TRAN: Random, right?\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>As a performer, what the appeal of these projects?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: It's almost like being a kid again, if that makes sense. It's also not tied to... This is going to sound so weird and actor-y. But because it's not tied to your face and I don't have to worry about what I'm doing, I can physically be jumping up and down while I'm voicing a character and it doesn't seem strange. I guess having the ability to just completely be unrestrained is very exciting to me.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>But then do you watch some of the things and see those movements in the character? Was there anything like that on <em>Croods 2</em> where you did a facial expression and then it wound up in the movie?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And <em>Croods 2</em>, specifically, has been such a joy to work on because Joel [Crawford], who directed it, we just had the best time just improvising. Honestly, it got really weird, and I think that's good. In some of those sessions…\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How did it get weird?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Yeah. In some of those sessions... Did you get a chance to watch it?\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yes.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Okay, great. The whole thing with Dawn sort of going into this really intense, I don't want to say bro-y because I don't think it's the right word, but almost like intense wrestler voice was just from improvising and us having fun. And the scenes where she's under the influence of a bee sting, <em>ha-ha</em>, those scenes are just... It just was so much fun to find this character doing these things and just to be completely, again, unrestrained and just not... I guess, any time you can feel like you're in that mode of play without feeling judged is a really special thing, and I find that is particularly true with a lot of the animation stuff I've been able to do. I just feel this freedom, which I think I'm chasing at the moment.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/croods-2-family.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>\n\n<p>\nYou started obviously in sort of improv and sketch comedy. Do you feel yourself tapping into that same well for these things?\n</p></strong>\n<p>\nTRAN: Oh, yeah. Totally. And I think that's another thing that has made it such a joy, and especially during COVID. I miss doing improv shows in random indie theaters in LA. I just miss doing weird comedy. I think that doing voiceover has really sort of tapped into that part of me and it's brought me a lot of joy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Were you a fan the first <em>Croods</em>? Did you know the world immediately when they came to you with the sequel?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Yeah. And also, when you audition for something, you get an audition notice, and then you look at something and you're like, &quot;Oh, I know what this is.&quot; And I feel the same way about all the properties I've done when it comes to this kind of stuff, <em>Star Wars</em> stuff, all of it. You get an audition and you look at it and you don't think to yourself that you're actually going to get it. Do you know what I mean?\n</p>\n<p>\nYou think, &quot;Oh, I know this world. This is awesome. This is going to be so much fun,&quot; and you just go in as an actor, you do the best work you can, you just leave it at the door. I used to do this thing before I was auditioning for things that were a secret that I couldn't even get the sides to. But I used to do this thing in auditions where I would just take the sides that I had for the audition and just toss them afterwards and just have this weird, <em>okay, I had my fun in the room</em> and I don't try to judge my fun based on whether or not I get a part, if that makes sense. I try to make the reward what happens in the room.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Well, you keep getting hired, so you must be doing something right.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: We'll see.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lego-star-wars-holiday-special-disney-plus.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>You are in the <em>Lego Star Wars Holiday Special</em> that just came out as well. Do we think Rose had more lines in the <em>Lego Star Wars Holiday Special</em> than in <em>Rise of Skywalker</em>?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Oh my goodness. Do we think? Do we have to count?\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I think we have to count.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: That was so much fun. I love Rose. I have such an attachment to my time playing in that world and being that character. I'm just excited for people to see more of her. So yeah, that was really fun.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>In this house, we stan Rose as well. We just watched <em>The Last Jedi</em> again this weekend, not even prompted by this.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Aw, I love that.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do you have a favorite <em>Star Wars</em> fan interaction or experience that you've had?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Yes. Absolutely. And this was actually... I was in London I think for the London premiere of the movie and I had brought one of my best friends, Caitlin, who also... She and I went through UCB together and Second City, so we're both improv weirdos. She was my roommate when I booked the part of Rose, so she sort of saw me through this whole experience. And we're sitting in this... I remember because I think we had just seen <em>Cursed Child</em> because we're also huge Harry Potter fans. This interview is going off the rails, by the way. I'm just totally...\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No, it’s perfect.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Okay. So we had just seen <em>Cursed Child</em>. Imagine us and we're in this little pub, in the upstairs, eating meat pies. So good. And we're sitting there eating these meat pies, and I hear this table of like 10 people to the right of us who had just seen <em>The Last Jedi</em> and were fully discussing what they thought of this movie. I'm just sitting there with my friend, Caitlin, just eating these meat pies. So I just went over there and I was like, &quot;Hey, guys,&quot; and they were like, &quot;Hey.&quot; I was like, &quot;I just wanted to say, I heard you talking about <em>The Last Jed</em>i. I play Rose and I just wanted to say hi.&quot; And I just think it's so exciting to be part of something that people love so much that they want to sit around a table in a pub and talk about it afterwards. I always think about how much of a privilege that is to be making things that a large amount of people want to see. It's sort of like a cultural touchstone. Then I just hung out with them for a little bit, and that was one of my favorite experiences because it just was sort of the encapsulation of me, for the first time, really working in this world and really experiencing being part of something that is so much bigger than me. And seeing the joy it brought other people was pretty cool.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I also love that it's a story about you going to someone else and not someone else coming up to you.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Yeah. I'm a total freak, yeah. I was just like, &quot;Oh, I'm just going to causally interrupt a meal right now.&quot;\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raya-and-the-last-dragon.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>\n\n<p>\nI have to ask about <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em> before I go, because everyone I've talked to you at Disney Animation just says that you came in and knocked it out of the park and everybody loves working with you, so just so you have a good reputation over there.\n</p></strong>\n<p>\nTRAN: Oh my gosh. Wait, that's so nice. That means so much.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What has that been like for you? You're a Disney princess now.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Yeah. I am so thrilled and freaked out. Obviously, it's such a privilege to work with these incredible artists who truly... I grew up watching Disney films, as pretty much, I don't want to say everyone, but most people grew up on Disney films and just being such a fan of that world. And then to be able to come in and work with all of these incredible people who... Sometimes I'll have a conversation with someone and be like, &quot;Cool, cool.&quot; I'll go on IMDB and Google and them and be like, &quot;Whoa, they worked on <em>The Lion King</em>,&quot; and all these other things and it just freaks me out. It is just so cool.\n</p>\n<p>\nYeah, I always say this, and I know it sounds so cheesy because it probably is, but I just think it's true, everything that I've been able to do in my career this far very much feels like an impossible miracle. I am not someone who had connections in this industry. I'm not someone who knew how to do that. I really feel like I was like the blind leading the blind, trying to figure out how to audition and this world. Everyone who has dreams as a kid watching these movies and wanting to be a part of it, if there's anything that can prove that it's possible to do anything, it’s that somehow I am where I am continuing to do the things that I'm doing. Yeah, it means a lot to me that you, yeah, that you said that about the people that you know at Disney because I just love everyone there so much. I'm just grateful.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><em>Croods 2</em> leaves things pretty open. You could come back. Would you jump at the chance to return?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTRAN: Yes. Yeah, absolutely. I had such a great time working on it. And also I still have not met Nic Cage and I find this to be a travesty. So I will do the third one just to meet Nic Cage. Make it happen, DreamWorks. Come on.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n\n<p>\nI hope post-quarantine, you and Nic Cage go out for seafood buffet or something.\n</p></strong>\n<p>\nTRAN: Like why hasn't this happened? Yes.

franchises have been as integral to the evolution of the superhero movie genre than <strong><em>X-Men</em></strong>, which helped usher in a new era of comic book movies alongside films like <strong><em>Blade</em></strong> and <strong><em>Spider-Man</em></strong>. With 2000’s <em>X-Men</em>, the comic book series was adapted as a story about humanity first and foremost, drawing parallels to the civil rights movement and the struggle of minorities everywhere. That combination of human drama and high-flying spectacle made <em>X-Men</em> wildly popular, spawning a franchise that has thus far comprised 13 feature films diverse in tone, cast, and of course time period.\n</p>\n<p>\nIndeed, the <em>X-Men</em> movies are not just fun, they’re <em>complicated</em>. Unraveling the <em>X-Men</em> timeline is a bit of a challenge due to the franchise’s malleability over the years – semi-reboots and prequels and spinoffs all kept the series fresh, but complicated its continuity.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo if you’re looking to watch the <em>X-Men</em> movies but unsure which order to go in, we’ve put together a handy guide to your two best viewing options – chronological order of events within the films, or simply arranged by the order in which they were made. Both ways have their merits, but the chronological order offers up a bit of a unique twist on things as the order in which events occur doesn’t always correspond to when (and by whom) each film was made.\n</p>\n<p>\nHere’s how to watch the <em>X-Men</em> movies in order. And if you’re looking for a guide to other timeline-intensive franchises, check out our rundowns of MCU Movies in Order and <strong><em>Fast &amp; Furious</em></strong> Movies in Order.\n</p>\n<h2>\nX-Men Movies in Chronological Order</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/x-men-first-class.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>X-Men First Class</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis prequel is the earliest-set <strong><em>X-Men</em></strong> movie in the universe, with most of the action taking place in the year 1962 as a young Charles Xavier (<strong>James McAvoy</strong>) teams up with a young Erik Lensherr (<strong>Michael Fassbender</strong>) to track down a former Nazi mutant scientist (<strong>Kevin Bacon</strong>). The film is set against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>X-Men: Days of Future Past</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a tricky one. So technically most of the action of <strong><em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em></strong> takes place in the year 1973, but it’s also a future-set movie that simultaneously takes place in the year 2023. Future Wolverine (<strong>Hugh Jackman</strong>) has his consciousness sent back to his 1973 self so he can prevent Bolivar Trask (<strong>Peter Dinklage</strong>) from using Mystique’s (<strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong>) blood to create indestructible Sentinels in the future. As if that wasn’t confusing enough, by the end of the movie, Future Wolverine successfully changes the past, potentially erasing the entire 2023 timeline we just witnessed <em>as well as</em> all the events that happened in <strong><em>X-Men</em></strong>, <strong><em>X2</em></strong>, and <strong><em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em></strong>. Moving forward from 1973, there is a new path forward for the mutants that may be slightly different than the one they previously traveled. As filmmaker <strong>Bryan Singer</strong> <a href=\"https://collider.com/x-men-apocalypse-new-timeline-explained-bryan-singer/\">explained</a>:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n“Part of the philosophy we had at the end of Days of Future Past is that you can’t fully change the course or current of the river, but you can just divert it a little bit, and we diverted it a little bit… Any possibility could occur, but characters are still moving towards their immutable place.”\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nSo you have two options when it comes to watching <em>Days of Future Past</em> — either watch it second for the 1973 setting, or watch it last as a finale that kind of undoes the entire timeline and concludes with a “New Future” where adult Professor X and Jean Grey are still alive.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</strong>\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/x-men-origins-wolverine-hugh-jackman-1.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nThe first-ever <strong><em>X-Men</em></strong> spinoff movie was the much-maligned <strong><em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em></strong>, which ostensibly tells the origin story of Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine character. The story actually begins all the way back in 1845, when a young Logan’s powers first manifest, but the film largely takes place in the year 1979 and reveals how Logan lost his memory.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>X-Men: Apocalypse</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nSo this “prequel” most closely follows the events of <em>X-Men: First Class </em>and the 1970s setuff in <em>Days of Future Past</em>, as <strong><em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em></strong> is set in the year 1983 and finds the young adult versions of the X-Men battling the world-ending (and centuries-old) villain Apocalypse (<strong>Oscar Isaac</strong>).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Dark Phoenix</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe last film to feature the “young” <em>X-Men</em> cast is <strong><em>X-Men: Dark Phoenix</em></strong>, which takes place in the year 1992 and adapts the iconic <em>Dark Phoenix</em> comics storyline. By the end of the film Jean Grey (<strong>Sophie Turner</strong>) has transformed into a Phoenix, which somewhat muddles how it connects to the next film chronologically.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>X-Men</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nSo for <strong><em>X-Men</em></strong> to work, you kind of have to ignore the events at the end of <em>Dark Phoenix</em> – but otherwise it fits quite well. The first <em>X-Men</em> movie to be made roughly takes place in the year 2000, as it was set in present day when it was released.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>X2: X-Men United</strong>\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/x2-mckellen-romijn-jackman-berry.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nThe first <em>X-Men</em> sequel, <strong><em>X2: X-Men United</em></strong>, takes place roughly three years after the events of <em>X-Men</em>, in the year 2003.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>X-Men: The Last Stand</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe final sequel in the original franchise line, <strong><em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em></strong>, takes place in the year 2006.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Wolverine</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n20th Century Fox tried again with something of a reboot for the Wolverine character, as <strong><em>The Wolverine</em></strong> serves as a sequel to both <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> and <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em>. It takes place in the year 2013 and finds Logan wrestling with the trauma of Jean Grey’s death in <em>X2</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Deadpool</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe R-rated Marvel Comics adaptation <strong><em>Deadpool</em></strong> is only tangentially connected ot the <em>X-Men</em> timeline, but if you want to be a completionist it takes place in the year it was released – 2016.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The New Mutants</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a weird one. Director <strong>Josh Boone</strong> initially wanted the long-delayed Fox-Marvel movie to take place in the 1990s, but after the box office disappointment of <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> he was asked to make it present day. Now, <a href=\"https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/new-mutants-marvel-movie-mcu-timeline/\">Boone contends</a> that the story “started being in the original <em>X-Men</em> timeline” but is now its own thing with tangential connections to the <em>X-Men</em> universe. So roughly this movie takes place in 2017, but there are no major timeline ramifications for what happens within the story.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Deadpool 2</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe sequel <strong><em>Deadpool 2</em></strong> actually features a very brief cameo from the young <em>X-Men</em> cast, as it takes place in the year 2018. It also features some meta time-travel jokes as Deadpool goes back in time to the events of <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> and kills <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>’ previous iteration of the Deadpool character.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Logan</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nA high-water mark for the franchise, the R-rated drama <strong><em>Logan</em></strong> is the movie whose action mainly takes place the furthest in the future – in the year 2029. It serves as a finale of sorts, featuring worthy canonical deaths of major characters.\n</p>\n<h2>\nX-Men Movies in Order of Release</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/logan-20th-century-studios-dafne-keen-patrick-stewart.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<em>X-Men</em> – July 14, 2000\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>X2</em> – May 2, 2003\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em> – May 26, 2006\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> – May 1, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>X-Men: First Class</em> – June 3, 2011\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Wolverine</em> – July 26, 2013\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em> – May 23, 2014\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Deadpool</em> – February 12, 2016\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> – May 27, 2016\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Logan</em> – March 3, 2017\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Deadpool 2</em> – May 18, 2018\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dark Phoenix</em> – June 7, 2019\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The New Mutants</em> – August 28, 2020\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/deadpool.jpg\">\n</figure>","direction":"ltr"},"title":"X-Men Movies in Order: How to Watch Chronologically or by Release Date","author":"Adam Chitwood","crawled":1606494666926,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://www.collider.com/rss.asp","title":"Collider - Feed","htmlUrl":"https://collider.com"},"published":1606476358000,"summary":{"content":"We run down the entire X-Men timeline and show you how to watch all 13 X-Men movies in chronological order, or by release date.","direction":"ltr"},"alternate":[{"href":"https://collider.com/x-men-movies-in-order/","type":"text/html"}],"visual":{"url":"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/x-men-first-class.jpg","width":2000,"height":1247,"processor":"feedly-nikon-v3.1","contentType":"image/jpeg"},"canonicalUrl":"https://collider.com/x-men-movies-in-order/","unread":true,"engagement":539,"engagementRate":0.48},{"id":"uM+MqpK9duOyb/imN0cFmOAhKFCAsXozhxb+qTAQU1w=_1760a8b40ae:179b20b:951e5be4","keywords":["News"],"originId":"https://collider.com/the-crown-season-4-helena-bonham-carter-interview/","fingerprint":"3b25ebfa","language":"en","content":{"content":"<p>\nOne of the most striking, impactful episodes in <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/the-crown/\"><strong><em>The Crown</em></strong></a> Season 4 is Episode 7, “The Hereditary Principle.” The episode focuses on Margaret (<strong>Helena Bonham Carter</strong>) as she hits an uncertain and lonely chapter in her life. After spending the majority of her life as a central member of the royal family and a kind of bon vivant status in society, Margaret feels suddenly adrift as a 50-something divorcée with no concrete duties tasked to her by her sister, Queen Elizabeth II (<strong>Olivia Colman</strong>). Over the course of “The Hereditary Principle,” <em>The Crown</em> explores this uncertain time in Margaret’s life as she adjusts to her new circumstances, while simultaneously uncovering a dark family secret involving two disabled cousins who spent their lives in an institution.\n</p>\n<p>\nBonham Carter had the chance to discuss Margaret’s standalone episode and the princess’s diminished role in Season 4 during a recent press junket Collider participated in. The actor opened up first by saying, “It was a wonderful episode. It was wonderfully written. Really Margaret, her story, I don’t feature that much in Season 4 and that’s kind of Margaret’s part in real life. As she got older, she became more and more marginalized within the family and felt so. There’s a sort of ironic thing where the more children her sister has, it means the lower she goes in the pecking order; she becomes more and more irrelevant.”\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-crown-season-4-helena-bonham-carter-margaret-car.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nShe continued,\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n“Episode 7, which is called ‘The Hereditary Principle,’ starts with you seeing that Margaret is middle-aged, the divorce has happened, she’s on her own, she’s trying to have a relationship and it doesn’t really work out. She has a lung operation, which happened and [the tumor] was benign, but it was still scary and major. Then just when..she’s really floundering for some kind of identity, I think coupled with being in her mid-50s — was she? I don’t know, that’s what I am but I’m overidentifying — but in the middle of her life and having a crisis.”\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nUnfortunately, there wasn’t an easy solution to Margaret’s problems, because as Bonham Carter explained,\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n“She goes to her sister and asks for more work and at that point she’s told she’s actually going to lose work and status because Prince Edward has become of age. So, she really has depression (which she was very prone to in life), and she seeks therapy. It’s in the context of the therapy room that she discovers the other cousins who had mental health issues that were utterly different to hers. It’s known, the press found out about it but I can’t remember when — in the ‘90s, I think — of these Bowes-Lyon cousins who were institutionalized. It’s the story of that and how she generally feels treated by her family and the harshness of their treatment although, at the same time, always remaining very, very loyal to her sister, too. It’s complicated. It’s a sad episode, but it’s wonderful. It was a gift.”\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-crown-season-4-helena-bonham-carter-margaret-prince-charles.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBonham Carter then focused on how “The Hereditary Principle” discusses Margaret’s mental health journey, comparing and contrasting the attitudes around seeking treatment for depression in the 1980s versus seeking treatment today: “There’s no doubt that if [Margaret] had lived in a different time, she would have had an entirely different life. She would have fared far better now. It is so much more forgiving in some ways, and in other ways, we’ve got extreme intolerance, but that’s a reaction to the huge amount of tolerance that we have about talking about things like mental health. It was not on to have depression in her time and certainly wasn’t on really to have depression in that family.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe actor concluded with a sharp observation about Margaret’s situation at the time and the effects of the attitude that a family’s stance like the one shown in “The Hereditary Principle” could have on a person: “It’s very Victorian, and it’s very, almost, military-like and unforgiving of any kind of human emotional frailty.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Crown</em> Season 4 is now available to stream on Netflix.

Others (most, to be honest) called him Baby Yoda. <strong>Werner Herzog </strong>called him &quot;the baby,&quot; as in, &quot;I would like to see the baby,&quot; as in what everyone says when they watch an episode of <em><strong><a href=\"http://collider.com/tag/the-mandalorian\">The Mandalorian</a></strong></em>, that hit Disney+ <em><strong>Star Wars </strong></em>series in which <strong>Pedro Pascal</strong>'s masked bounty hunter flies from planet to planet performing various favors for colorful acquaintances.

And it is...Grogu.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrogu? [Checks closed captioning]\n</p>\n<p>\nOkay, yes, it is Grogu. Although you wouldn't be able to pry the words &quot;Baby Yoda&quot; from my brain with <em>two</em> white lightsabers, we at least know &quot;Grogu&quot; is what the little green guy would put on a business card. Also, thanks to wayward Jedi Ahsoka Tano—played here for the first time ever in live-action by <strong>Rosario Dawson</strong>—we know a startling amount more about Grogu's backstory. Here's what Ahsoka said in &quot;The Jedi&quot;:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\nHe was raised at the Jedi Temple in Coruscant. Many masters trained him over the years. At the end of the Clone Wars, when the Empire rose to power, he was hidden. Someone took him from the temple. Then his memory becomes…dark. He seemed lost. Alone. I’ve only known one other being like this. A wise Jedi master named Yoda.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nThat's a whammy of a reveal for <em>The Mandalorian</em>, a show that doles out information one massive planet-hop at a time. But, of course, we're still left with <em>dozens</em> of questions about Grogu. Firstly: &quot;How was there a second member of Yoda's famously rare species chilling at the Jedi Temple for the entirety of the prequel series without anyone mentioning that information?&quot; Secondly: &quot;Did Yoda bang?&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nAll these questions and more will presumably be answered at some point by <em>The Mandalorian</em>, which is bearing down on its season 2 finale in just three weeks.

So whether you've got a gamer on your holiday shopping list or are a gamer yourself, you might be wondering just what 2020 titles offer the best bang for your buck. Which games are <a href=\"https://collider.com/game-awards-2020-nominees-voting/\">worth the purchase price</a>? Which ones will keep you playing for mere hours or <a href=\"https://collider.com/best-long-video-games-to-play/\">for days and weeks to come</a>? And which titles are appropriate for gamers of all ages and interests?\n</p>\n<p>\nThat's where we come in! The following list of 18 video game titles, all new in 2020, is here to give you a good starting place when it comes to your shopping list. Black Friday sales and other discounts abound this time of year, so if you see one of the following titles pop up, it's a safe bet to do so, as far as we're concerned. Your mileage may vary, of course, but these are the stand-out games of the year in a variety of categories. And hey, you can always make that special someone on your list <em>super</em> happy by picking up a next-gen console like the Xbox Series S/X and/or, if you're incredibly lucky, a <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/playstation-5/\">PlayStation 5</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nHappy gaming!\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>For Family-Friendly Gamers---<em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FX6DTLcWUdY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nIf you're looking for a fun, colorful game you can share with the whole family, look no further!\n</p>\n<p>\nDespite some frustrations with its battle mechanics, this delightfully silly game is a laugh-a-minute experience, as our own <strong>Gregory Lawrence</strong> said in his <a href=\"https://collider.com/paper-mario-origami-king-review/\">review</a>. The 2D characters you know and love battle against the Folded Soldiers and the threat to turn the Mushroom Kingdom into all-out origami. The latest entry in the flattened franchise managed to expand both the mythology of <em>Paper Mario</em> and the world itself, delivering plenty of laughs alongside some surprisingly emotional character moments. It's well worth a pick-up, especially for younger gamers just getting into the fun of all things <em>Mario</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars, Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>For Fans of Platformers---<em>Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdRZGc1mQkU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nFor many gamers, platformers are the go-to sub-genre of the industry. <em>Crash Bandicoot 4</em> is a great return to form for these fans in particular and all gamers in general.\n</p>\n<p>\nToys for Bob came back in a big way with this new installment of the PlayStation platformer darling. Once known for bursting onto the video game scene ruled by the Super Mario Bros. and their Sega counterpart Sonic the Hedgehog, Crash brings nearly 25 years of running, hopping, crate-smashing experience to bear in this title. <em>It's About Time</em> feels like a throwback and a modern game at the same time, bringing plenty of classic mechanics (and options) to consoles while also pushing the franchise's story forward (and backwards, and, well, you get it) and introducing fun new wrinkles (in time). It's a blast, and an easy pick-up this holiday season if you're so inclined.\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em><a href=\"https://collider.com/trollhunters-defenders-of-arcadia-review-switch/\">Trollhunters: Defenders of Arcadia</a></em> - If you have a youngster on your list who is just getting into action-oriented video games, this back-to-basics platformer based on the hit Netflix animated series is a great choice!\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>For RPG-Enthusiasts---<em>Persona 5 Royal</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LFzh6T7bQ_M\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nIn <strong><em>Persona</em></strong><em>, </em>the massive Japanese franchise that is itself part of the more-massive <em><strong>Megami Tensei</strong></em> series, ATLUS may have found itself a worldwide success as Western markets embrace the series' signature style and personality.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><em>Persona 5 Royal</em></strong> is an enhanced edition of <em><strong>Persona 5</strong></em> that brings new characters and new material to the story, but it also comes as a complete version of the vanilla game with all the available DLC included. That's not just a bargain, it's a selling point for the company who's had similar success with past releases. <em>Persona 5</em>, including <em>Royal</em>, is now the best-selling game in that franchise, and might just be the <a href=\"https://collider.com/best-video-games-2020/\">best game of the year overall</a>. But while it might not reach many casual audiences, it should absolutely be on every RPG fanatic's wishlist.\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake, </em><em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Genshin Impact</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>For Fans of Metroidvania Video Games---<em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-QFOJ_L6yFM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nThe relatively new sub-category of action-adventure games dubbed &quot;Metroidvania&quot; takes aspects of the classic <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Castlevania</em> franchises and mashes them up in interesting new ways. You'll often find a large, 2D world map that's open to exploration by the player, but limited depending on what upgrades, skills, and tech you've acquired in the game so far. Those level-ups won't just help you clear the map but defeat enemies as well. Make sense? Even if it doesn't, that's okay; you'll still want to pick up <em><strong>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</strong></em> regardless.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhy? Well, it might be the 2020 Game of the Year. It's a gorgeous game with a compelling story and characters to boot; it picks up from the acclaimed 2015 title, <em><strong>Ori and the Blind Forest</strong></em>, also from Moon Studios. However, new 3D models and many-layered levels and backgrounds add more depth to the experience, just as the new story does the same with Ori's mythology. The only thing better than picking up the 2020 title is getting a two-for-one!\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Carrion</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>Our Pick for 2020 Rogue-likes---<em>Hades</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mD8x5xLHRho\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nAnother relatively new sub-category of games is the so-called &quot;rogue-likes&quot;, often a dungeon-crawling fantasy-tinged RPG with procedurally generated levels and a permadeath component. Sounds fun, right?\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong>Hades</strong></em> changes up the typical <em><strong>Diablo</strong></em>-styled fantasy element for more of a classical pantheon of the Greek gods&quot; inspiration, which <strong>Rafael Motamayor</strong> brilliantly discussed <a href=\"https://collider.com/hades-game-review/\">in this piece</a>. The write-up also helps to explain just why <em>Hades</em> is such a unique and compelling game, through and through, and why it keeps being talked about, even as it vies for a Game of the Year award. But even if you've never picked up a rogue-like before or aren't into Greek mythology, <em>Hades</em> will give you a chance to play like a god for once ... and who doesn't love that?\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Monster Train</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>Our Go-To Souls-like Game of 2020---<em>Demon's Souls (PS5)</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TMs2E6cms4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nOur last &quot;-like&quot; sub-category goes back to the games that pretty much invented it: FromSoftware's <em><strong>Souls</strong></em> series of games. Known for brutal difficulty and outstanding boss fights, the latest entry in that franchise is a modern remake of its first title, <em><strong>Demon's Souls</strong></em>, released back in 2009. They never looked back ... well, at least not until they looked back to release the title as a PS5 launch exclusive this year.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll signs point to the newly refurbished <em>Demon's Souls</em> being just as tough and enjoyable(?) as its original release. The hardest part may not be taking down bosses like the Vanguard Demon, but securing a PS5 to play it in the first place.\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Nioh 2</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>For Gamers Who Are Into Social Sims &amp; Management---<em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_3YNL0OWio0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\n<em><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></em> was all anyone could talk about for the better part of this year. Nintendo's real-time &quot;life simulation&quot; game saw players taking on the role (and responsibilities ... and cost ... and headaches) of a community manager tasked with developing an island paradise for anthropomorphic citizens and visitors alike. It was an instant hit. It remains one of the best-selling video games of all time in Japan, within the franchise itself, and for the Nintendo Switch. So what was it about the stylized &quot;life management game&quot; that was a hit with folks all around the world?\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother Game of the Year contender, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> hit at roughly the same time as the world shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A silver lining and good timing for Nintendo. With more free time and downtime than ever before, gamers found some solace and comfort in the fact that they could still grow and harvest crops, visit shops, and perform other relatively mundane tasks in the virtual world at a time when they couldn't do the same in the real world. Add to this the fact that Nintendo updates the game with new content every few months, and you've got a hit that keeps on giving\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Spiritfarer</em>, <i>Mars Horizon -- </i>If you want to try a life simulation that's actually got a bit more of a fantasy or sci-fi element to it, respectively, try these!\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>Get Tactical With This 2020 Title---<em>Gears Tactics</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_uxj1c7fPzM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nWhen you think about real-time strategy (RTS) games, you don't often think <em><strong>Gears of War</strong></em>.

There’s always been a sense of humor implicit within the revolutionary 3D pixel walls of <b><i>Doom</i></b>; in <i>Eternal</i>’s campaign, developed by iD Software and published by Bethesda, a gnarled, satirical, <b><i>They Live</i></b>-esque taste of comedy is present in every bite. As you shoot and chainsaw and “glory kill” your way through scourges of demons and mutated soldiers, robotized voiceovers remind us cheerfully that this overtaking of Earth by the most grotesque and bloodthirsty of Hell’s demons is actually a good thing for the good of our corporate overlords (an always-laugh-out-loud comedic clash of context that reminded me of other Bethesda games like <b><i>Fallout</i></b>).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe game wears its Mature rating like a performative badge of pride, blood and guts dripping throughout the screen, backgrounds oozing with genuinely upsetting, <b>Hieronymus Bosch</b>-esque designs (all of which I can’t wait to see rendered even more explicitly in the forthcoming free next-gen update). It shamelessly traffics in aesthetics that my sixteen-year-old self would’ve simply luxuriated in, would’ve been eager to try and buy from my local GameStop without getting carded, and I can’t tell you how refreshing it was to dive into this horror-metal-loving world with no sense of self-seriousness or detachment again. It’s a simple-on-the-surface rush of adrenaline, this game, but it’s not without its deeper additions to structure. Your Slayer (aka DoomGuy) can do some mild platforming, including a nifty double jump and wall-climbing ability. You may not be able to, or need to, aim with precision, but you’ve got all kinds of dope mods you can add to your arsenal, and some fun puzzle-solving that comes with which mod to use on which demon. And if you wanna dive into its multiplayer, you’ll spend plenty of time on its <b><i>Dead by Daylight</i></b>-leaning Battlemode, which allows you to play either as a Slayer <i> or </i> a Demon, giving you tons of deep, RPG-leaning, high-difficulty-curve options to play with.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you’re looking for a gloriously blunt antidote to some of the more saccharine trappings of the holiday season, <i> Doom Eternal</i> will give you all the goofy, gruesome, gigantic pleasures you need and more. - Gregory Lawrence\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops - Cold War</em>, <em>Marvel's Avengers</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>The Best Title for Action-Adventure Gamers---<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zbq7BnsQhrw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nOne of the best new properties of the year is Sucker Punch Production's <em><strong>Ghost of Tsushima</strong></em>. It's a solid game, through and through, with little to criticize or wish the Devs had done differently. The core game itself got a multiplayer bump (via a free upgrade) when <em><strong>Ghost of Tsushima: Legends</strong></em> arrived this fall. <em>GoT</em> is also on track to compete for the 2020 Game of the Year award. So is there any reason not to pick up this title immediately?\n</p>\n<p>\nNone that we can think of! The base game now comes with the newly updated DLC that lets you play along side your favorite samurai friends. But the main game itself also got a NewGame+ addition that gives you extra incentive to save the island of Tsushima all over again. That'll help you pass the time while we wait to see what Jin Sakai does next!\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em>, <em>Assassin's Creed: Valhalla</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>For the Sports Video Game Fans on Your List---<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/22MQBu_jiH4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nCall it a remake, call it nostalgia, call it a comeback, <em><strong>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 </strong></em>could have been a quick cash grab; it was anything but. If you've got a 90s skater, video game or IRL or anything in between, this remastered redo is an easy purchase to make.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe iconic title stays true to its roots and feels very familiar for fans who have been keeping up with the acclaimed franchise all along, but it brings some new tricks to the park as well. There's local split-screen play (a rarity these days) and online multiplayer available, and there are both create-a-skater and create-a-park options to mess around with. Perhaps best of all, the new game introduces new and up-and-coming skating sensations to gamers around the world alongside household names. Plus, who can resist those bombtracks?\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>F1 2020</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>This 2020 Fighting Game Came Out on Top---<em>Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f8o9bysnzoQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nIt's good to be the Khan.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you've got a gamer who's been duking it out in Earthrealm, Outworld, and/or Netherrealm since 1992, <em><strong>Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate </strong></em>is a must-buy. (Don't take my word for it; read our own <strong>Gregory Lawrence</strong>'s <a href=\"https://collider.com/mk11-ultimate-ps5-review/\">PS5 review here</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>\nThe core game is perfectly grand on its own, but the Ultimate version is what you're really looking for this (bloody) holiday season. It includes the &quot;Aftermath&quot; DLC expansion, as well as both Kombat Pack 1 and 2, the latter of which was released along with the Ultimate version mere days ago. If you hear the game shouting &quot;GET OVER HERE!&quot; to your bank account, it's best not to fight it.\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Street Fighter V: Champion Edition</em>, <em>Granblue Fantasy: Versus</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>When Simulator Video Games Are Realer Than Real Life---<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TYqJALPVn0Y\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nHow wild is it that 2020 became a year in which most people were actively discouraged from flying on airplanes, advice that many actually listened to? So perhaps it was the perfect time for Asobo Studio and Xbox Game Studios' hyper-realistic, all-Earth flying simulation. It arrived at a time when folks were feeling cooped up and had a bit of wanderlust, giving them a way to satisfy that need without sacrificing financial security or personal safety. So yeah, we'll give the game a break for its occasionally long load times and factual inaccuracies regarding real-world landmarks. It's the closest thing we have to safe, convenient travel at the moment and that's worth the world to us.\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Snowrunner</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>Get Some Friends Together for This Multiplayer Game---<em>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FcITAzKW3fY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nIf your gamer ever wanted to be a cute little bean bobbling around amongst other wildly dressed beans in a race to be the last bean standing, there is <em>literally</em> no other game out there like <strong><em>Fall Guys</em></strong>!\n</p>\n<p>\nFor a time, this surprise hit was a worldwide phenomenon. The Devs at Mediatonic and the sages at Devolver Digital took a super-simple premise and ran with it. They ran through walls, over obstacles, past whirlybirds and around Big Yeetus. They dodged the jinx and grabbed tail feathers, kicked oversized sports balls of all shapes and sizes, and outlasted the competition through skill, strategy, luck, and lots of laughter. It's a game that absolutely must be played with friends, but the good news is that those friend are folks you might just meet along the way as you race for the crown!\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>No Man's Sky, Among Us</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>Take Your Gaming Experience Into VR---<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nFjtVmka54E\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nVR is the way of the future. Sure, folks have been saying that for years, but it's never been truer than right now. More and more boundary-pushing ideas are being developed for the latest VR tech, just as the tech itself continues to make progress moving forward in terms of affordability, accessibility, and wow-factor. The iconic sci-fi franchise <em><strong>Half-Life</strong></em> went a long way toward making VR more of a household reality with its awards-worthy title, <em><strong>Half-Life: Alyx</strong></em>.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis ambitious approach to a beloved game mythology nestles itself between the first and second titles to take on the alien Combine. It features the same sorts of combat, puzzles, exploration, and thematic material the franchise has become known for, just with a VR twist. Valve has been tweaking their VR tech since the days of <em><strong>Portal</strong></em> and clearly continues to do so, leading to groundbreaking titles like <em>Alyx</em>. If you can pick it up for your VR rig, do it ASAP; it might just become the first legacy title for a whole new generation of virtual reality games.\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Iron Man VR, Star Wars: Squadrons</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>Go Mobile Game With This Top 2020 Title---<em>Legends of Runeterra</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNhKAJwlj04\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nDid you know that mobile gaming accounts for roughly half of the overall gaming market, to the tune of tens of billions of dollars? You probably did. Just like you knew that everyone is walking around with a veritable supercomputer in their purses and pockets these days. So even if you don't have a next-gen console or a cutting-edge GPU in your PC rig at home, you can absolutely find a mobile game you'll love on your very own mobile device.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur pick for this section is the surprisingly highly rated <em><strong>Legends of Runeterra</strong></em>, a free-to-play collectible digital card game developed and published in part by Riot Games and inspired by their massive hit <em><strong>League of Legends</strong></em> franchise. If you've played any similar card games, the mechanics are simple to pick up and pretty addictive, making it relatively hard to put down. If you're a fan of <em>LoL</em>, or the gamer on your list happens to be, this is an easy download ... even if it doesn't cost you a dime. You can, of course, drop some real-world currency on the game's in-game currency system in order to buy cards, but unlike similar games, you can buy exactly the cards you want instead of random packs that grant you the possibility of getting a good roll. Add to this the fact that <em>Legends of Runeterra</em> is in its infancy compared with other big-name card games, and this is one to check out sooner than later.\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Harry Potter: Puzzles &amp; Spells</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>In a Year of Remakes, This One's the Best---<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERgrFVhL-n4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\nRemakes used to have a bad connotation -- many still do -- but modern redos of classic and beloved games have started to change fans' opinions of the word and the new industry it's inspired. (TV shows do this pretty well, too. Movies... maybe not so much.) So what we have here is a win/win: Studios can take existing IP they own and bring about a bold new vision and version of it to the masses, and those masses can enjoy a title they have fond memories of in a lovely new iteration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> </em>is how you do a remake. Capcom has done an admirable job with their <em><strong>Resident Evil</strong></em> titles, but now it falls to Square Enix to carry that torch forward. And <em>boy</em> do they have a lot of IP to work with. A remake of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has perhaps been the title that fans have made the most noise for over the years, and now we've got it. It's drop-dead gorgeous, and its fully rendered characters have reignited the Tumblr-verse all over again. Re-imagined combat will shake you out of the turn-based ease you know from the original game while beautifully realized cut scenes will let you see Midgar City and Mako Reactors in a whole new light.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut be careful what you wish for: <em>FFVIIR</em> covers just the first third or so of the original game, and we don't quite know what the plans are for the rest of the story going forward. For now, it's a solid standalone remake of an all-time classic, and that's enough.\n</p>\n<p>\nHonorable Mention(s): <em>Resident Evil 3, Destroy All Humans!, Mafia: Definitive Edition</em>, <em>Demon's Souls</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<strong>And Finally, the Best 2020 Video Game for Mature Audiences---<em>The Last of Us: Part II</em></strong></h2>\n<div>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXl9GI1p_Os\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://collider.com/last-of-us-2-review/\">I've written extensively</a> about <em><strong>The Last of Us: Part II</strong></em> this year, and this probably won't be the last time I do so. It's a game that's stuck with me since its release this summer, a fact that's unlikely to change in the months and years ahead. It's not just a continuation of the fantastic original story that won over so many fans around the world, and it's more than the fallout of <a href=\"https://collider.com/last-of-us-2-joel-death-neil-druckmann/\">a single storytelling decision</a> that many angry fans have reduced it to since its release. It's a treatise on violence, revenge, and most importantly, <a href=\"https://collider.com/last-of-us-2-ending-explained/\">forgiveness</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Last of Us: Part II</em> is absolutely my pick for <a href=\"https://collider.com/last-of-us-2-game-of-the-year-controversy/\">Game of the Year 2020</a>. It's important, it's timely, and it's perhaps more meaningful now than ever.

Even though Harper still isn’t out to her family, she decides to ask Abby to come home with her for the holidays to meet her parents and sisters. The thing is though, they’ve got to keep their relationship a secret. While Harper and her big sister Sloane (Brie) are constantly battling to be #1 in their parents’ eyes - adhering to mom and dad’s (Steenburgen and <b>Victor Garber</b>) lofty expectations of them in the process - their younger sister Jane is mighty content loving the things she loves regardless of what anyone thinks.

Here’s how Holland put it:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n“Jane really just came to life in me in a way that was so fun. In writing Jane, we knew that we wanted her to be this joyful character and this person who just really has such a deep level of self acceptance. But being on set I was, as Jane, just so excited that everyone was in the room and to be around everybody, and that lead to this sort of bouncy energy physically that was cool to discover on the set in those dynamics.”\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nIf you’d like to hear more from Holland about her first feature screenwriting experience and from DuVall about the directors who’ve influenced her craft behind the lens the most, be sure to catch the full conversation at the top of this article!\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/happiest-season-alison-brie-mackenzie-davis-mary-holland.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<b>Clea DuVall and Mary Holland</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nDuVall highlights the acting projects that have influenced her craft as a director.\n</li>\n<li>\n<i>Happiest Season</i> marks Mary Holland’s first feature screenplay.

From romance to fantasy to family-friendly animated adventures, the streaming service is going all-in on that holiday cheer, but as always, there are also some classics, crowd-pleasers, and nostalgic favorites among the onslaught of originals new to Netflix this month.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou can check out a complete list of all the <a href=\"https://collider.com/new-to-netflix-november-2020/\">new movies and shows on Netflix in November right here</a>, but if you’re looking for a little guidance, we’ve put together a list of highlights and recommendations for what to watch. From the existential lows of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> to the candy-coated highs of <i>Jingle Jangle</i>, check out our picks below.\n</p>\n<h2>\nOcean's Eleven</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/oceans-eleven.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<b>Director: </b>Steven Soderbergh\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Writer: </b>Ted Griffin\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cast: </b>George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner, Shaobo Qin, Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould\n</p>\n<p>\nAs far as crowd-pleasing films go, <b>Steven Soderberg’</b>s <strong><i><a href=\"http://www.collider.com/tag/oceans-eleven/\">Ocean’s Eleven</a></i></strong> easily sits in the upper echelon of endlessly rewatchable, absurdly charismatic gems. And if old-school Hollywood movie stars are a dying breed, the 2001 heist comedy might be one of the last times an ensemble commanded attention on sheer star power alone. Clooney. Pitt. Damon. Roberts. And on and on and on, <i>Ocean’s Eleven </i>puts that megawatt superstar ensemble to excellent use, banking on their charms and Soderberg’s command of genre to deliver a boom-pow, ooh-ah cinematic fireworks display.\n</p>\n<h2>\nA Clockwork Orange</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/a-clockwork-orange.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<b>Director/Writer: </b>Stanley Kubrick\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cast: </strong>Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee, Adrienne Korri, Miriam Karlin, Michael Bates\n</p>\n<p>\nNothing says holiday spirit like… Ultraviolence? Hmmm perhaps not, but there are <i>plenty </i>of Christmas movies on Netflix and <i>plenty </i>more arriving this month (see below), so if you’re not feeling the seasonal glow, <b>Stanley Kubrick’</b>s 1971 classic is an always reliable – and disturbing – anti-establishment watch. The highly-lauded, equally controversial satirical comedy-thriller stars <b>Malcolm McDowell </b>in an iconic performance as Alex, the depraved leader of a violent gang of delinquents called the Droogs, who winds up a subject in a cruel experimental rehabilitation.\n</p>\n<p>\nKubrick luxuriates in the horrific deeds of the Droogs, ensuring the audience’s abject dread, and then he exploits that dread to turn the tables faster than you can say “Holy heck, is that actually in his <i>eye</i>?”, transforming it into a big-picture grotesquerie that wags a cheeky, disdainful finger at societies that seek to enforce justice through injustice. It’s one of the squirmiest, most meticulous – it is Kubrick after all, and downright best dark satires ever made. Which is no surprise because, again, it’s <i>Kubrick</i>.\n</p>\n<h2>\nEasy A</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/easy-a.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>Director:</strong> Will Gluck\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Writer:</strong> Bert V. Royal\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cast:</strong> Emma Stone, Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Thomas Hayden Church, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell\n</p>\n<p>\nGood news, Malcolm McDowell stans, this month on Netflix is a two-for-one! Ok, so McDowell isn’t exactly the main draw in <strong><i><a href=\"http://www.collider.com/tag/easy-a/\">Easy A</a></i></strong>, but he does play one dang delightful high school principal! <b>Will Gluck’</b>s 2010 teen comedy updates ‘The Scarlet Letter’ with the story of a teenage girl who decides to embrace her new image when a rumor goes wrong, pinning her as the girl who sleeps around. <b>Emma Stone </b>stars in the role that, along with <i>Zombieland</i>, which also hit theaters in 2010, cemented her as a household name after her breakout performance in <i>Superbad</i>. And she’s just a joy; witty and charming, as ever, a powerhouse of charisma and comedic timing, which makes <i>Easy A</i> an always reliable feel-good watch that will have you chuckling, singing “Pocket Full of Sunshine” for the next few days, and wishing <b>Stanley Tucci </b>and <b>Patricia Clarkson </b>were your parents.\n</p>\n<h2>\nFruitvale Station</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fruitvale-station-1.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<b>Director/Writer: </b>Ryan Coogler\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cast: </b>Michael B. Jordan, Melonie Diaz, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Durand, Chad Michael Murray\n</p>\n<p>\nThree for three, every time <b>Ryan Coogler</b> and <b>Michael B. Jordan </b>team up for a movie, you know it’s going to be something special. The duo stepped into the stratosphere of superstardom with the knockout one-two of <strong><i>Creed </i></strong>and <strong><i>Black Panther</i></strong>, but if you missed Coogler’s 2013 feature directorial debut, <strong><em><a href=\"http://www.collider.com/tag/fruitvale-station/\">Fruitvale Station</a></em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong> there couldn’t be a better time to get caught up. Adapting from the true-life tragedy of Oscar Grant, Coogler crafts a remarkable, straight-forward, and shatteringly effective drama set across the last hours of Grant’s life before he was shot and killed by a BART police officer.\n</p>\n<p>\nCoogler never flinches in staging the injustice for what it’s worth, but he takes just as much time to celebrate the life of Oscar Grant, conveying the tragedy of a life cut short by honing in on the poetic minutiae of every minute leading up to his last breath. Jordan gives a stunning performance through every beat, and it’s immediately obvious why the two haven’t stopped teaming up since. <i>Fruitvale Station </i>is a must-watch movie in its own right a wrenching drama, a potent reminder of the humanity behind every headline, and the value of every life, but in a year where police violence and racial injustice so politicized they’re somehow considered partisan issues, it’s absolutely essential viewing.\n</p>\n<h2>\nJingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/forest-whitaker-jingle-jangle.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>Director/Writer: </strong>David E. Talbert\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cast: </strong>Forest Whitaker, Anika Noni Rose, Keegan-Michael Key, Phylicia Rashad, Hugh Bonneville, Madalen Mills, Ricky Martin, Justin Cornwell, Sharon Rose\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this year’s lineup of new Netflix Christmas movies,<strong> <i><a href=\"http://www.collider.com/tag/jingle-jangle/\">Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey</a></i></strong> easily comes out on top of the pack. Starring the great <b>Forest Whitaker</b> as Jeronicus Jangle, a famed toymaker reeling from heartbreak after an apprentice (<b>Keegan-Michael Key</b>) stole his most prized design, the film follows Jeronicus on his journey back to the joy of creation after his grandaughter (<b>Madale Mills</b>) shows up and turns his life back around. This movie is just <i>stuffed </i>with cheer, stacking musical sequences on animated scenes on vibrant set and costume design that makes for a buzzing, kaleidoscopic celebration of festivity, innovation, and family.\n</p>\n<h2>\nThe Princess Switch: Switched Again</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-princess-switch-2-switched-again-image-9.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<b>Director</b>: Mike Rohl\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Writers: </b>Robin Bernheim and Megan Metzger\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cast: </b>Vanessa Hudgens (and Vanessa Hudgens and Vanessa Hudgens), Sam Paladio, Nick Sagar, Mark Fleischmann, Suanne Braun\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you saw Netflix’s deliciously breezy and confidently silly Christmas Comedy confection <strong><i><a href=\"http://www.collider.com/tag/the-christmas-switch/\">The Princess Switch</a></i></strong>, you pretty much know what to expect from the sequel. Mistaken identities! Romance! Hijinks! Because, as the title tells you, they’re <i>Switched Again</i>. This time, however, star <b>Vanessa Hudgens </b>is doing triple duty, with the introduction of a swanky, sneaky royal cousin who sets her sights on the throne via a, you guessed it, identity swap. <i>Switched Again </i>is twice as silly as the original (and yes, that <i>is </i>saying something) and not quite as endearing, but it’s Christmas comfort food that absolutely delivers on the empty-calories appeal of what it’s selling. Netflix has pretty much cornered the market on better-than-average-but-still-very-dumb holiday romances since 2017’s <i>A Christmas Prince </i>because they give the people what they want. And there’s no shame in wanting a little extra cheese during the holiday season.\n</p>\n<h2>\nDolly Parton's Christmas on the Square</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dolly-partons-christmas-on-the-square.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>Director:</strong> Debbie Allen\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Writers:</strong> Dolly Parton and Maria S. Schlatter\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cast:</strong> Dolly Parton, Christine Baranski, Josh Segarra, Jenifer Lewis, Jeanine Mason, Mary Lane Haskell, Treat Williams, Selah Kimbro Jones\n</p>\n<p>\nDo ya want to spend Christmas with <strong>Dolly Parton</strong>? Yeah, of course you do. It’s not that <i><strong>Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square</strong> </i>is a good movie. It’s definitely not. But it knows that and it’s okay with it, and so am I because that’s not what either of us showed up for. There are, however, two very good reasons to show up for this one. Obviously, Dolly, who’s singing all original songs she wrote for the film. They’re not her best work, but when Dolly sings, I listen. Second is the wonderful <strong>Christine Baranski</strong>, who makes a meal of every line delivery as a Scrooge-y owner of a small town that learns to embrace the Christmas spirit with some help from a Dolly Parton angel. It’s all very campy, a Christmas pageant with a Netflix budget – and yes, it’s all very Godly, but when the message of faith and kindness comes from a bonafide samaritan and a track record of good deeds as long as Dolly Parton’s, you know its earnest. And that’s the real trick to <i>Christmas on the Square</i>, it’s such a product of genuine Good Will Towards Men, overflowing with Parton’s pure spirit (and some squee-worthy sequined angel-wear, while we’re at it) that you can’t help but feel a little cheerier when it’s over.\n</p>\n<h2>\nAlien Xmas</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/alien-xmas-tree.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<b>Director: </b>Stephen Chiodo\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Writers: </b>Kealan O’Rourke, Dan Clark, Noah Kloor\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cast: </b>Keythe Farley, Dee Bradley Baker, Kaliayh Rhambo, Michelle Deco, Barbara Goodson, Jessica Gee-George\n</p>\n<p>\nA kids’ Christmas movie from the filmmakers of <i>Killer Klowns from Outerspace</i>? Say no more, I’m in. Adapting from the 2014 book of the same name, co-written by director <b>Stephen Chiodo</b>, the Chiodo brothers put their stop-motion sorcery to work in a sub-hour Christmas special that updates the charms of the classic Rankin &amp; Bass stop-motion Christmas specials for a new generation. With powerhouse producers like <b>John Favreau </b>and <b>Karen Gilchrist </b>on board, Netflix’s <b>Alien Xmas </b>had all the right WTF factors to ensure I tuned in as soon as it was available, and happy to report, it’s a charming Christmas treat that’s a bit thin, but thanks to the 40-minute runtime, never stretches its charms beyond their payoff.\n</p>\n<p>\nImagine The Grinch, except its little kleptomaniac aliens coming to steal your Christmas spirit and you’ve pretty much got the gist of it. If you’re not familiar, the Chiodo Bros are some of the most spectacular stop-motion craftsmen in the biz, having provided the enduringly disturbing puppets for <i>Team America: World Police</i> and the North Pole segments of <i>Elf</i>, and in keeping, <i>Alien Xmas </i>features some pretty stunning animation.\n</p>\n<h2>\nThe Christmas Chronicles 2</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-christmas-chronicles-2-kurt-russell-goldie-hawn.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<b>Director: </b>Chris Columbus\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Writers: </b>Matt Lieberman and Chris Columbus\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cast: </b>Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn, Julian Dennison, Darby Camp, Jahzir, Bruno, Tyrese Gibson, Sunny Suljic, Darlene Love, Judah Lewis\n</p>\n<p>\nAre you ready for more Hot Santa? <b>Kurt Russell’</b>s surprisingly sexy St. Nick is back in <strong><i><a href=\"http://www.collider.com/tag/the-christmas-chronicles/\">The Christmas Chronicles 2</a></i></strong>, and this time, he brought along <b>Goldie Hawn</b> as a similarly smokin’ Mrs. Clause. It’s always nice to see America’s mom and dad thriving, and while the sequel to Netflix’s 2018 Christmas hit doesn’t quite recapture the charm of the original, the <b>Chris Columbus</b>-helmed followup packs a whole lot of cheer into its romp through the North Pole. Of course, Russell and Hawn are a reliable delight, but there’s also a lot of fun to be had with <i>Hunt for the Wilderpeople </i>breakout <b>Julian Dennison</b>, who channels his signature sense of humor as an angsty elf determined to end Christmas for good. Like most of Netflix’s Christmas content, you know what you’re gonna get with <i>The Christmas Chronicles 2</i>, and while it may not be a new Christmas classic (when was the last time we got one of those?), its a solid pick if you’re looking for something to watch with the whole family.\n</p>\n<h2>\nMosul</h2>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mosul-movie-image-1.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>Director/Writer:</strong> Matthew Michael Carnahan\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cast:</strong> Suhail Dabbach, Bilal Adam Bessa\n</p>\n<p>\nMuch of Netflix’s most interesting productions have sprung from their international creative teams of late, from the satirical thriller <i>The Platform </i>earlier this year, to the steady stream of bingeable international series like <i>Dark </i>and <i>Money Heist</i>. That trend is set to continue with <i>Mosul</i>, the new war thriller produced by the Russo Brothers, which follows a SWAT team waging a guerilla fight to take back their city from ISIS. <i>Mosul </i>has been earning a lot of good buzz leading up to its Netflix release, and the early reviews confirm the raves, hailing the film as one of the year’s best action movies with an artful balance of explosive thrills and tight character drama.\n</p>","direction":"ltr"},"title":"The 10 Best New Movies to Watch on Netflix in November 2020","author":"Haleigh Foutch","crawled":1606419315788,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://www.collider.com/rss.asp","title":"Collider - Feed","htmlUrl":"https://collider.com"},"published":1606400824000,"summary":{"content":"Not sure what to watch on Netflix this month?

I know. I know! Full disclosure, if it was up to me I'd be firing off completely harmless features about how many times you see <strong>Pedro Pascal</strong>'s chin in <strong><em>The Mandalorian</em></strong> then log off to attend a Thanksgiving dinner without a single worry I might sneeze into the sweet potatoes and kill off a substantial portion of upstate New Jersey. But that's not reality; reality is living day-to-day with a virus that's spiking again, and reality is the impossibility—especially when it's your <em>job</em>—of separating the art you consume from the context you consume it in. &quot;Turn off your brain and enjoy it&quot; is a privilege of an un-anxious mind, but it also ignores the fascinating ways great art can bend itself through time; how a great film can hit completely different at a different point in your life. This point? It's been lonely. It's been scary. It's been misery.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeamlessly transitioning: <strong><em>Misery</em></strong> hit theaters 30 years ago this week.\n</p>\n<p>\nPurely on its own terms, <em>Misery</em> is a success story full of small miracles. <strong>Rob Reiner</strong> is not the first name to pop into anyone's head when it comes to horror, but <em>Misery</em> marks his second time converting the works of <strong>Stephen King</strong> into a classic, after <strong><em>Stand By Me</em></strong>. It's also a book that has no business working as a movie; <em>Misery</em> is an isolated two-character affair that relies heavily on the inner musings of its main character, Paul Sheldon, an author being held captive after a car wreck by his psychotic #1 fan, Annie Wilkes. The casting didn't make things any less complicated. For Paul, you have famously ill-tempered <strong>James Caan</strong>—accepting the role after almost a dozen first-choices turned it down—on the other side of a personal downslope and looking for a career comeback. For Annie, <strong>Kathy Bates</strong> in her first major film role, at the time a relative unknown to the general audience outside of Broadway.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/misery-kathy-bates-james-caan.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nObviously, three decades on, <em>Misery</em>'s success can't be denied. Bates won a Best Actress Oscar for her role. Caan added another defining role to his legacy while barely moving his legs. The sight of Annie absolutely demolishing Paul's foot with a sledgehammer—a feat of practical wizardry whipped up by <strong>Robert Kurtzman</strong>, <strong>Greg Nicotero</strong>, and <strong>Howard Berger</strong>'s KNB EFX Group—is rightfully listed alongside some of the most iconic horror images of all time. The movie holds up, is what I'm saying, and the most obvious parallel to draw is between the horror of being locked up by an obsessive fan and the horror of being locked up because of an all-consuming virus. It's not the same scenario, but they share a sense of futility, of having our hands metaphorically—in Paul's case, literally—tied to our sides by something unreasonable. That's the undercurrent of Misery that remains vital throughout the years; it's just the Annies that change. For King, it was dope. &quot;Annie was my drug problem, and she was my number-one fan,&quot; he told The Paris Review in 2006. &quot;God, she never wanted to leave.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nOur modern-day Annie Wilkes doesn't love us, but God, it doesn't want to leave.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/misery-james-caan.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\nBut that's not even the scariest part of watching <em>Misery</em> in 2020. It's not just Bates' ever-shifting performance or the claustrophobia of <strong>Barry Sonnenfeld</strong>'s Hitchcock-inspired cinematography. It's the normal, steady passage of time that does not stop because you can't leave the house. The crux of the film is Annie forcing Paul to write another entry in his massively popular &quot;Misery Chastain&quot; romance series, and the most horrifyingly familiar sight in <em>Misery</em> becomes someone who, among all this terror, has to just...get to work. He has to work while pretending his situation hasn't devolved into a constant state of fight-or-flight. Even if it's just the moments he's at the typewriter, while his fingers are moving, he has to briefly shut out the constant klaxon sirens of anxiety just to survive. (A disturbing note the book touches on more than the movie is that, in these moments, Paul cannot help himself from feeling thrilled by the work, even under the circumstances.) It reminds me of how normal isolation has become, and how disturbing it is that we had to normalize it in the first place. Thanks to 2020, the single scariest sequence in <em>Misery</em> is the montage of Paul's work, day after day as the snow turns to rain, a reflection of everyone in America realizing &quot;two weeks of quarantine&quot; meant something without a clear ending and still having to just...get to work.\n</p>\n<p>\nI don't know what &quot;the other side&quot; of our situation looks like. Paul Sheldon got the shit kicked out of him by Annie Wilkes then bashed her head in with a ceramic pig, which medical professionals have informed me is not a legitimate way of defeating COVID-19. But I do keep returning to the final scene of <em>Misery</em>, 18 months after Paul's escape, the author sitting in a restaurant—imagine!—and telling an editor he'd rather not &quot;dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we can make a few bucks.&quot; But he still sees Annie, walking toward him with a knife, not the <em>actual</em> Annie but a specter he still thinks about &quot;once in a while.&quot; The scariest thing about Annie—about <em>Misery</em>—is that there is no &quot;other side&quot;; there is survival and then there are scars that last the rest of your cockadoodie life.\n</p>","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Why Misery Hits Harder in 2020","author":"Vinnie Mancuso","crawled":1606414193392,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://www.collider.com/rss.asp","title":"Collider - Feed","htmlUrl":"https://collider.com"},"published":1606395981000,"summary":{"content":"Rob Reiner's Stephen King adaptation Misery turns 30 this week, but thanks to the claustrophobia of 2020 it has never been more powerful.","direction":"ltr"},"alternate":[{"href":"https://collider.com/why-misery-movie-hits-harder-in-2020/","type":"text/html"}],"visual":{"url":"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/misery-kathy-bates-james-caan.jpg","width":1200,"height":720,"processor":"feedly-nikon-v3.1","contentType":"image/jpeg"},"canonicalUrl":"https://collider.com/why-misery-movie-hits-harder-in-2020/","unread":true,"engagement":25,"engagementRate":0.01},{"id":"uM+MqpK9duOyb/imN0cFmOAhKFCAsXozhxb+qTAQU1w=_17605a53d51:f3e681:58da7475","keywords":["News"],"originId":"https://collider.com/the-sneider-cut-ep-60-deadpool-3-new-predator-movie-lukas-gage/","fingerprint":"7d99b8b9","language":"en","content":{"content":"<p>\nHappy Thanksgiving!

In a series of inventive, energetically animated shorts, he gave Mickey (now voiced by <strong><em>Silicon Valley</em></strong> star <strong>Chris Diamantopoulos</strong>) a personality. This was a Mickey that got angry and frustrated and <em>lashed out</em>. The shorts took place in far off lands and put Mickey in a variety of extremely cartoon-y scenarios. And they were a huge hit for Disney, revitalizing Mickey Mouse for a new generation and inspiring a hit attraction at Disney’s Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in Florida (soon coming to Disneyland too).\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd all of these years later, the shorts are still on the air. The latest iteration is <strong><em><a href=\"http://collider.com/tag/the-wonderful-world-of-mickey-mouse/\">The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse</a></em></strong>, which just premiered on Disney+. These new shorts are longer and even more colorful, allowing for Rudish and his collaborators to go even further and have even more oversized fun.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe were given the opportunity to chat with Rudish, a longtime collaborator of <strong>Genndy Tartakovsky</strong> on things like <strong><em>Samurai Jack</em></strong> and the 2003 version of <strong><em>Star Wars: Clone Wars</em></strong>, about all things Mickey Mouse – how the original shorts came to be, whether or not there is ever external pressure about what to include in the shorts, working with Pat Carroll (who reprises her role from <strong><em>The Little Mermaid</em></strong>) in the upcoming roller disco episode, and what it was like bringing Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway to the Disney Parks.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Collider: When were you first contacted about the possibility of taking over these Mickey Mouse shorts and what were your initial thoughts back then?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nPAUL RUDISH: Well, I originally was brought into Disney Television to just do some development and to look into the heritage characters, look into the library and the Disney characters and see if there was something I can put a spin on or develop a show out of some of their properties. And I was actually very interested in Mickey Mouse. My love is the 1930s Mickey Mouse cartoons and it's like, well, if they want to make cartoons, what if we use their most famous cartoon character and make cartoons again?\n</p>\n<p>\nBut then I thought, <em>Oh, Mickey's going to be too precious</em>. <em>I don't think they're going to let me do that. Is there a way I could secretly trick them into letting me do a Mickey Mouse cartoon</em>?\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd then almost on cue [senior vice president of Disney Television Animation] Eric Coleman came in my office and said, &quot;Hey, I hear are you like Mickey Mouse?&quot; And I felt like I was busted. I was like, &quot;Uh-oh wait, what am I caught?&quot; And at the time Bob Iger had charged all of the departments at Disney to develop something new with Mickey Mouse. And at TVA they're like, &quot;Well, we'd like to put you on this project since you already have an interest in it.&quot; And it just started from there and so I did get into my love of the 1930s, rubber hose Mickey, and did a couple of storyboards and pitched those and they were well received and took off.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/wonderful-world-of-mickey-mouse-social-1.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>At that point, Mickey had become an anonymous corporate figurehead and you really gave him a personality again. Was that one of the things that you really wanted to do?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: I don't think it was necessarily conscious that I wanted to do that more so than I really loved the cartoons from the '30s and I just thought that, that's naturally the way that we can do Mickey Mouse. I didn't think there was anything subversive about taking a page from the 1930s playbook, it's like that seems perfectly natural and if we're going to make Mickey Mouse cartoons, let me think about the ones I like, and let's try to follow suit in that style of humor.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd so I think I just approached it naturally, not really thinking that it was so out there or a change of pace, it was just like, &quot;Oh yeah, I like these kinds of cartoons. Let's make more like this.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>These shorts are very bold stylistically, including your use of music. Did you ever come up to any guard rails about any of that stuff or were you just given free rein?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: Surprisingly, there were no guard rails. The folks at Disney were very encouraging about the direction in the way it was going and yeah surprisingly very little safety net. Not a lot of roadblocks, hardly any, to tell you the truth. Again, people at the company were very supportive of where it was going and it kept on going.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Did you ever think you would still be doing them all these years later?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: It's funny. We just kept doing them and kept doing them and it felt normal and then you get your head out of your office and you go, &quot;Wait a minute, we've been doing this for nine years now?&quot; It feels like maybe two or three, it's just become a time warp.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Can you talk about the response to this version of the character, since for a new generation this is what they respond to as Mickey Mouse? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: Well, I mean, again usually I'm just had my head down in my desk and it's just the process, the day-to-day fun of working with my artists and lots of great people. It just feels like a very natural kind of thing, very comfortable.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut then you step out into the world and then you go, &quot;Whoa, wait a minute. Oh, I forgot. This is Mickey Mouse, he's a big deal.&quot; I thought he was just a friendly cartoon character who was a friend of mine, but then I go, &quot;Oh wait, no, he's a friend of the world and oh my gosh, he's all over the place.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nIt makes you reel a little bit and yeah, I end up feeling very honored after the fact that we've been able to just shepherd one of the world's favorite characters in a very popular way. To see audiences all around the world really responding to these, is quite flattering and very odd. Because when we're working on it, it's very comfortable and feels very personal. You get reminded that the world is watching. Oh, wow. I forgot.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-18-at-2.49.19-PM.png\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>Can you talk about these new shorts? Because they are a little different. They’re a lot longer and they have a different thematic grouping, right? (Earlier batches have been based on international locations.)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: Well, with the new shorts for Disney+, they were very much staying in the same sense of humor and style, the animation and all of that. But in the three-and-a-half-minute shorts we had done previously, we found that we had to trim everything down and make the stories very, very tight and very Mickey-centric and often Mickey was his own foil. He would fall into a problem of his own making and then find his way out but with the longer format, now we can even get more of the characters from the Fab Five. We can have more opportunities to get our great dynamic of Mickey, Donald, Goofy in some situations, screwing things up. We have more opportunities to have an actual antagonist. Pete and Mortimer will both show up as an actual villain to the story. We have more room for different points of view from different characters instead of always having Mickey being the singular focus.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd so that's been fun to be able to play with the other characters more, get their voices, get their opinions in on it. And schematically for the season, we were looking at setting certain stories in what could possibly be the lens of Disneyland. There's a Frontierland episode, a Fantasyland episode, a Tomorrowland, so borrowing those kinds of scenes this time. And more genre pieces in this go around.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-little-mermaid-ursula.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>Can you talk about working with Pat Carroll from <em>The Little Mermaid</em> on the roller disco installment? What was that experience like for you?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: It's funny, it was done remotely. Our voice director and a sound engineer flew out to Cape Cod, I believe, where she currently lives and we did a phone patch recording. They went out to her house, set up the mic and so we were on the phone getting her lines. She was great and was so funny and she could still do the cackle and yes, she was just really out there. I didn't get to interact with her personally, but yeah, she had some salty jokes that she could say off-mic and yes, she was a delight.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>As the prominence and level of exposure of these shorts grows and the importance of them within Disney as a corporation intensifies, do they ever lean on you to highlight some aspect of the parks or synergy or something like that? Or are they ever like, “We would really love it if we could highlight <em>Little Mermaid</em> because we're putting it back out on DVD,” or something like that?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: Not really. We don't really get a lot of requests for synergistic tie-ins or anything like that per se. Earlier there were requests for certain locations, like when we were doing the international-flavored ones, where we would set ones in different countries. We would even get requests based on &quot;Disney stuff is really popular in this particular country, is there a way you guys could be more in country X?&quot; And so we would look into it and we would try to develop a story that would take place in that country. This season hasn't really been focusing on that. We haven't really gotten any requests like that.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Is there any endpoint that you see the Mickey shorts coming to, or is this something that could go on for years and years?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: I certainly think Mickey can go on for years and years, it's up to Disney and what they want to do with him. He certainly has the stamina to keep going.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Are there any characters from the Disney stable that you wish you could use and maybe haven't been able to, or haven't found a place for in the shorts that you are really still looking to play with?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: Hmm.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You haven't done an all-out Oswald installment yet, have you? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: No. No. I like that we have the ability to dip into anyone, any of the characters in the entire library. And we just play it by ear and go, &quot;Who's going to be the silliest cameo at this particular moment?&quot; So not necessarily, “Do I really want to get Peter Pan in there?” As much as I love <em>Peter Pan</em> and some of my favorite movies. I'm not like gunning to go, &quot;How do we sneak in a Peter Pan joke?&quot; We let those jokes find themselves organically as we go.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mickey-and-minnies-runaway-railway-concept.jpg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>What was it like working on the Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway attraction, and how it was seeing your show in dimensional life in Florida and soon in Disneyland?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nRUDISH: Getting to collaborate on Runaway Railway was a dream come true. I always wanted to grow up to be Marc Davis and so, yeah it was a fabulous experience getting to go behind the scenes at WDI, be there from the inception of the project, brainstorming on gags and tone. And then finally seeing how they could engineer these things to actually work practically was fascinating.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd then our team produced the two-dimensional animation in the ride. So I was aware of the entire process all the way through, but then when we finally got to fly out to Florida and check it out when it opened, it was a whole other thing. It was like, I had never seen anything about it before, even though I've been working on it for three years. The final product was so amazing and unique. It was a treat to be able to do that.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse <em>is now streaming on Disney+</em>.\n</p>","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Mickey Mouse Creator Talks New Shorts, Disney World Ride","author":"Joseph Andrew Taylor","crawled":1606412058323,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://www.collider.com/rss.asp","title":"Collider - Feed","htmlUrl":"https://collider.com"},"published":1606393696000,"summary":{"content":"Go behind the scenes of Disney+'s new animated short series 'The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse.'","direction":"ltr"},"alternate":[{"href":"https://collider.com/wonderful-world-of-mickey-mouse-paul-rudish-interview-disney-plus/","type":"text/html"}],"visual":{"url":"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/wonderful-world-of-mickey-mouse-social-1.jpg","width":1920,"height":960,"processor":"feedly-nikon-v3.1","contentType":"image/jpeg"},"canonicalUrl":"https://collider.com/wonderful-world-of-mickey-mouse-paul-rudish-interview-disney-plus/","unread":true,"engagement":10,"engagementRate":0.00}]}
